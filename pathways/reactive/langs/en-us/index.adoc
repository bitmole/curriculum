= Bootstrap:Reactive Pathway

@image{images/Logo.png, Bootstrap:Reactive}

Bootstrap:Reactive goes deeper into programming, building events and data structures on top of the foundation laid by our intro courses, allowing students to build far more sophisticated programs. Students learn how the world-based event loop that drives their Bootstrap:Algebra game works, and use it to create animations using simple datatypes for their world. They then learn about data structures, and design a World structure for a sophisticated game of their own design. Bootstrap:Reactive is aligned to the @link{../../Standards.shtml, CSTA standards and K-12CS frameworks}.

The final project in Bootstrap:Reactive can be used as the Create Task for AP CS Princples!

== Teaching Remotely?
If you're teaching remotely, we've assembled an @link{../../ImplementationNotes.shtml, Implementation Notes} page that makes specific recommendations for in-person v. remote instruction.
