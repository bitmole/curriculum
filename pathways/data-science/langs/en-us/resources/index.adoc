= Teacher Resources

- *Online Community* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Want to ask a question or pose a lesson idea for other Bootstrap teachers? Want to be kept up-to-date about Bootstrap events, workshops, and curricular changes? Our new discussion forum is the place to do it.

- *What's Going on in this Graph?* [@link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, nytimes.com}] - Once a month, the NYTimes posts an interesting data visualization. This is a great resource to spark the curiosity of young data scientists, and make for a perfect Notice &amp; Wonder activity!

- *The Pudding* [@link{https://pudding.cool/, link}] - Terrific deep dives into data analysis for interesting topics. Another wonderful resource for students, with great animations showing the transformation of how data is visualized as the research questions evolve.

== Project Files

Every student (or, ideally, every __pair__ of students) will need to save a copy of the @link{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZEIgM4zvxI7JizViVFZojnpd3Yr2rYe8puPk8pjOcs/copy, Blank Research Paper}. A @link{pages/final-paper-rubric.adoc, Grading Rubric} is also available for the research paper.

We have also compiled some @link{pages/datasets-overview.adoc, notes on these datasets}, which we recommend for all teachers before having their students choose a dataset.

Students can also import their data into a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=12v7kzbxHt2LaSe2uI2d_OnssxtTNF0A8, Blank Starter File}. They will need to modify this file for use with their dataset, and @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4n9hTSqcyw, this tutorial video} can walk them through it.
