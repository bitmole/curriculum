//Write a brief description of where this data comes from.
//Examples:
//
//- This dataset includes data from 271 Rhode Island public &
//  charter schools.
//- This data set looks at traffic stops in Durham, NC
//  between 2002 and 2013, recording the number of them that resulted in searches of the person
//  stopped. Data is broken down by age, race and sex.

This dataset looks at the 5000 most populous (as of 2020) cities in the world and their geographical information, such as elevation, country, continent, and distance from the nearest shoreline. The data comes from various sources, including the World Cities Database (for cities and population), the National Centers for Environmental Information (for worlds shoreline), JohnSnowLabs (for each country's continent), and the World bank (for country GDP per capita).

*Column Titles:*
//List columns below.


[.answer-roman]
--
- Name
- Country
- Population (2020)
- Continent
- Elevation (m)
- Distance to Shore (km)
- GDP per Capita ($) 2017. This refers to the country's GDP per capita.

//Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
//to deepen the analysis. For example:
//
//- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
//  black students at a school.
//- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
//  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

- *define* a function is-poverty, which returns true if a city's GDP per capita is below $15,000.
- *define* a function is-climate-change-prone, which returns true if a city's distance from shore is less than 20km and elevation is less than 10m.
- *define* a function is-metropolis, which returns true if a city's population is above 1 million dollars and GDP per capita is above $10,000.

*Heads Up*

//If there are outliers teachers should be aware of, please note them below. For example:
//
//- *Outliers to be aware of:* Only a few films are from before 2000.
//- *Outlier to be aware of:* Classical High School has test scores of zero.

//List any recommended calculations below. For example:
//
//- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
//  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
//  percentages would need to be calculated.
//- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
//  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.

- We can calculate the number of people from each continent who would be displaced by climate change that causes shoreline to receed by a certain number of kilometers. 
- We can calculate the percentage of city dwellers who live below a certain average annual income. 
- We can calculate the number of people who live in major cities in each continent.
