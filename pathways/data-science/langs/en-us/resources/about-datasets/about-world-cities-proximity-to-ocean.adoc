= World Cities Geography

- This dataset looks at the 5000 most populous (as of 2020) cities in the world and their geographical information, such as elevation, country, continent, and distance from the nearest shoreline. The data comes from various sources, including the World Cities Database (for cities and population), the National Centers for Environmental Information (for worlds shoreline), JohnSnowLabs (for each country's continent), and the World bank (for country GDP per capita). 

- This data set has a limited number of categories, making it accessible to any student.

- The columns of this data set are defined to allow students to start analysis without much additional coding.

*Column Titles:*
- Name
- Country
- Population (2020)
- Continent
- Elevation (m)
- Distance to Shore (km)
- GDP per Capita ($) 2017. This refers to the country's GDP per capita. 

*Have students...*
- *define* a function is-poverty, which returns true if a city's GDP per capita is below $15,000.
- *define* a function is-climate-change-prone, which returns true if a city's distance from shore is less than 20km and elevation is less than 10m.
- *define* a function is-metropolis, which returns true if a city's population is above 1 million dollars and GDP per capita is above $10,000.  

*Heads up*
- We can calculate the number of people from each continent who would be displaced by climate change that causes shoreline to receed by a certain number of kilometers. 
- We can calculate the percentage of city dwellers who live below a certain average annual income. 
- We can calculate the number of people who live in major cities in each continent.
