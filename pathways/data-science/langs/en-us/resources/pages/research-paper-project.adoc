== Overview

This project can be used as the capstone for Bootstrap:Data Science, and is designed to provide real-world and engaging connections to the following mathematical concepts: *SHOULD THE FOCUS HERE BE ON MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS?*

@span{.right}{@image{../../images/screenshot.png}}

- Bar Charts
- Pie Charts
- Histograms
- Box Plots
- The Shape of the Data
- Measures of Center & Spread
- Strength and Direction of Correlations
- Linear Regressions

The project culminates in a completed game that @link{http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/skf-creativity-bootstrap/,students feel proud of}, and can show off to their friends and family. Many Bootstrap teachers arrange publishing parties or data fairs, complete with tri-fold posters explaining their findings.

=== Students will be able to...

* Use the Data Cycle to develop new questions from the findings their initial questions lead them to
* Identify and explore grouped samples from within their dataset
* Identify Threats to Validity

=== Assessment and Grading
We provide a @link{final-paper-rubric.html, rubric for the paper}, but teachers should always feel free to edit and adapt it for their classroom.

== Structure of the Paper

The paper is divided into sections. Each section corresponds to a lesson with scaffolded activities and one or more workbook pages, which support students in writing a section of the paper. After learning about a tool for analysis as a class using our teaching dataset, students work in groups or pairs to apply that tool to their own dataset.

== Where Does it Fit?

The project is constructed over a series of lessons, which reinforce concepts learned in earlier lessons. Taken together, the game-focused lessons form the scope and sequence for the project. There are two options for implementation:

[.implementation-options, cols="1a,1a", options="header"]
|===
| Integrated
| All at Once

| The default lesson order for Bootstrap:Data Science has paper-focused lessons sprinkled throughout the curriculum, with students building their paper over a long period of time.

@vspace{1ex}

*Pros:* Students see each math concept as immediately relevant to their game, the game motivates the learning of additional math, and students have a "hook" for the whole course.

*Cons:* This approach requires access to computers at multiple points throughout the year, and teachers must work harder to keep the game development visible for impatient students.

| If students are already comfortable with algebra (including the Pythagorean Theorem), Circles of Evaluation, Simple Datatypes, Contracts, and Functions, they'll be able to complete their video games in 1-2 weeks. _All game-focused lessons can be saved to the end of the year._

@vspace{1ex}

*Pros:* Satisfying "captsone" for students, simpler scheduling for computer access, high-engagement activity during a typically low-engagement time of year.

*Cons:* Without a narrative project to tie everything together, students are less likely to see the "big picture" throughout the year.
