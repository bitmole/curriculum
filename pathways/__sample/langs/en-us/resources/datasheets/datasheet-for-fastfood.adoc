// task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?
// Please provide a description.
//

[.answer]
--

The dataset was created to provide interesting data
for middle school and high school students to learn
data science and statistics. In addition, through this
process of learning, students can gain some insights
on healthy choices of fastfood.

== Composition
include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=42..59]
// Question :comp-what:
//
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
//

[.answer]
--


The instances that comprise the dataset represent various fastfood
in America. These food items are the only type of instance.


--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=61..64]
// Question :comp-quantity:
//
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
//

[.answer]
--


There is a total of 461 instances.

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=66..75]
// Question :comp-representativeness:
//
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
//

[.answer]
--

It is a sample of instances from a larger set of all fast food.
The sample is not representative of the larger set since it doesn't
include all types of food produced for speed of service. 
For example, the sample mostly covers fast food commonly found in America,
excluding various other fast food cuisines.

// Question :coll-how:
//
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
// inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
//

[.answer]

The data associated with each instance is published by USDA,
and data is downloaded from the internet.

The sampling was to take fast food items from the USDA
FNDDS database while balancing the amount in each type 
and each vendor.
