== Composition
include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=42..59]
// Question :comp-what:
//
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
//

[.answer]
--



The instances in this dataset represent people, residents of the United States.

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=61..64]
// Question :comp-quantity:
//
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
//

[.answer]
--


3,852,132 instances are included in this dataset. Although there are more
instances from the original American Community Survey data, only the ones
with information about college majors were included in this dataset.

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=66..75]
// Question :comp-representativeness:
//
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
//

[.answer]
--


The dataset is a sample of residents of the United States. It is a
representative sample, as the Census Bureau focuses on geographic
coverage when selecting participants for each month's American Community
Survey. In addition, the Census Bureau randomly selects participants over
every month, increasing representativeness when looking at data from five
years. Finally, the Census Bureau reduces response bias by following up
several times to ensure that everyone who receives the American Community
Survey actually completes it.

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=77..81]

//
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,

[.answer]
--

Each instance consists of raw data, such as strings and numbers.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=83..86]

//
// Is any information missing from individual instances? If so,

// redacted text.
//

[.answer]
--


Not all instances have information about their college majors, employment status,
and income levels as it was unavailable through the American Community Survey data.

--

No

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=109..112]
// Question :comp-errors:
//
// Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
// dataset? If so, please provide a description.
//

[.answer]
--


Some college majors with median income calculations that were < $15,000
were removed as these would be below minimum wage and are likely due to
errors or insufficient data in the data collection process.

// Question :coll-how:
//
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
// inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
//

[.answer]
--


The data was reported by subjects and reviewed by the Census Bureau, with
follow-up communication to verify responses.

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=219..224]
// Question :coll-tools:
//
// What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
// (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
// software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
// procedures validated?
//

[.answer]
--

The Census Bureau uses manual human curation.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=226..230]
// Question :coll-subset:
//
// If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the
// sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with
// specific sampling probabilities)?
//

[.answer]
--


The Census Bureau uses random sampling based on geographic distribution.

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=231..247]
// Question :coll-time:
//
// Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe
// match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the
// instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not,
// please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with
// the instances was created.
//

[.answer]
--

This data was collected monthly from 2015-2019. This matches the creation
timeframe of the data associated with the instances.

//

[.answer]
--


The Census Bureau directly collected the data from the individuals
in question.

--

// other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or
// other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language
// of the notification itself.
//

[.answer]

The individuals provided the data themselves through the American
Community Survey. All American Community Survey data is publicly available.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=279..286]
// Question :coll-consent:

[.answer]
--

The dataset could be used for analysis of gender ratios in different majors
or analyses of the US economy based on unemployment.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=369..379]
// Question :use-future:
//
// Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
// way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
// impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
// user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
// treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
// of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
// harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
// anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
// harms?
//

[.answer]
--

Since this dataset is focused on college majors, it excludes those who have not
graduated from college. In addition, since it was cleaned to remove some majors with
possibly inaccurate information, it may be unfairly weighted towards majors with
high median incomes.
