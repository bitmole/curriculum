== Composition
include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=42..59]
// Question :comp-what:
//
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
//

[.answer]
--

Each instance represents a US state, with population and arrest data for the year 2018.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=61..64]
// Question :comp-quantity:
//
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
//

[.answer]
--


There are 49 state listed (data was not available for Florida).

--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=66..75]
// Question :comp-representativeness:
//
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
//

[.answer]
--

The dataset includes nearly every possible instance with the exception of Florida, for which data
was not available. It also does not include the District of Columbia or any other US territories.




--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=77..81]
// Question :comp-content:
//
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
//

[.answer]
--

Each instance consists only of numbers and strings. The legalization year, decriminalization year,
and medical marijuana legalization year are all treated as strings, as some have multiple values
(indicated by a "/") and many have no value (indicated by the string "No").



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=83..86]

No information is missing from individual instances.

There are no recommended data splits.

// Question :comp-errors:
//
// Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the
// dataset? If so, please provide a description.
//

[.answer]
--


The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, from which this data originates, uses data from 18,000 agencies
across the country. Participation in this program is voluntary, and some agencies refuse to participate. Data from missing
agencies was imputated by a method outlined in the ACLU report, but this is not 100% accurate. However, the majority of
agencies did participate, so this error is expected to be very small. A deeper analysis of the error sources is included 
within the ACLU report.

//
// Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age,

//

[.answer]
--

The data breaks the population of each US state (with the exception of Florida) down by race, specifically
identifying the white and black subpopulations.


--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=174..193]
// Question :comp-sensitivity:

// data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government
// identification, such as social security numbers; criminal
// history)? If so, please provide a description.

The dataset contains no information that would be sensitive to specific individuals.

== Process Collection

// Question :coll-how:
//
// How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was
// the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings),
// reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly
// inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags,
// model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by
// subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the
// data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
//

[.answer]
--

The data was acquired from an ACLU research report entitled "A Tale of Two Countries - Racially Targeted arrests
in the Era of Marijuana Reform", which obtained its data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program.


--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=219..224]

//
// What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data
// (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation,
// software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or
// procedures validated?
//

[.answer]
--

The data was collected directly from a pdf published by the ACLU. A Python script was used to convert it into a .csv file
which could be read by Google sheets.




--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=226..230]
// Question :coll-subset:
//
// If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the

// the instances was created.
//

[.answer]
--

The data was collected into this dataset from the ACLU report in January 2021. The ACLU compiled the report in 2020.
The drug arrest and population data reflects values from 2018, and the marijuana legalization data reflects values that were true
as of March 2020.

//

[.answer]
--


Very little preprocessing was performed; the only preprocessing that occurred involved combining two tables from the ACLU report 
together, and replacing empty cells with the string "No".

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=365..367]
// Question :use-potential:
//
// What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?
//

[.answer]
--

The dataset could be used for essentially study of the relationship between the racial makeup of a population and
marijuana-related arrests, as well as comparing the impact of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on crime rates.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=369..379]
// Question :use-future:
//
// Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the
// way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might
// impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future
// user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair
// treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality
// of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial
// harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there
// anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable
// harms?
//

[.answer]
--

The legalization dates listed are only true as of March 2020. Any future users should research recent marijuana legalization events 
and amend the dataset accordingly before performing an analysis.

Additionally, users should be aware that data for the state of Florida was not included, and remember to not generalize findings 
from this dataset to all 50 US states, as only 49 are represented.



--

include::datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc[lines=381..384]
// Question :use-dontuse:
//
// Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If
// so, please provide a description.
//

[.answer]
--

The dataset only reflects values for 49 US states, and holds data for two races. It should not be treated as a general analysis
of worldwide marijuana use, as the laws, regulations, and culture surrounding marijuana use vary greatly by country. It should also
not be generalized to other races such as Latinxs.

Additionally, this data should not be used to imply any causality between the legalization of marijuana and any changes in arrest
rates. That sort of analysis would, at minimum, require the dataset to include data for each state both prior to and after the 
legalization of marijuana.
