= Teacher Resources

- *Online Community* [@link{https://discourse.bootstrapworld.org/, link}] - Want to ask a question or pose a lesson idea for other Bootstrap teachers? Want to be kept up-to-date about Bootstrap events, workshops, and curricular changes? Our new discussion forum is the place to do it.

- *Workshop Slides* [@link{https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/spring2020/courses/data-science/en-us/resources/teachers/BootstrapDataScienceWorkshopSlides.pptx, pptx}] - The slide deck we use in our PD workshops, in PowerPoint format. This includes the background and context slides, as well as all slides used during the professional development workshops.

- "What's Going on in this Graph?" [@link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, nytimes.com}] - Once a month, the NYTimes posts an interesting data visualization. This is a great resource to spark the curiosity of young data scientists, and make for a perfect Notice &amp; Wonder activity!

- "The Pudding" [@link{https://pudding.cool/, link}] - Terrific deep dives into data analysis for interesting topics. Another wonderful resource for students, with great animations showing the transformation of how data is visualized as the research questions evolve.

Students can also import their data into a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=112j5-gF_BLpDWI_qzgaOseOhp6YbteD8, Blank Starter File}. They will need to modify this file for use with their dataset, and @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4n9hTSqcyw, this tutorial video} can walk them through it.
