= Bootstrap:Data Science Pathway

// logo 

What factors make some people live longer than others? Are more
expensive restaurants really better? Is voter fraud a problem?
What data would you need to gather to answer these questions, and
how would you measure that data to get your answer? Answering
real questions in the world involves analyzing data large
datasets, from sports stats to record sales to census
information.

In Bootstrap:Data Science, students form their own questions
about the world around them, analyze data using multiple methods,
and write a research paper about their findings. The module
covers functions, looping and iteration, data visualization,
linear regression, and more. Social studies, science, and
business teachers can utilize this module to help students make
inferences from data. Math teachers can use this module to
introduce foundational concepts in statistics, and it is aligned
to the Data standards in CS Principles.

The final project in Bootstrap:Data Science can be used as the
Create Task for AP CS Principles!
