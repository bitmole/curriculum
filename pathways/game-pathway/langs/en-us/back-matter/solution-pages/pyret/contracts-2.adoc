= Contracts

Contracts tell us how to use a function. For example: 
`num-sqr {two-colons} (n {two-colons} Number) -> Number` tells us that the name of the function is `num-sqr`, it takes one input (a `Number`), and it evaluates to a `Number`. From the contract, we know `num-sqr(4)` will evaluate to a `Number`.
