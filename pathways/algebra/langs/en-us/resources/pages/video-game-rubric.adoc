| Needs Improvement

| Title
| Both the title and the title color were customized.
| The title OR the title color was not customized.
| The title and title color were not customized.

| Images
| The images are appropriately sized and face the right direction. They make sense in the game and it is easy to discern which image is the danger / target / player.
| The sizing of the images is slightly off and/or they face the wrong way. The images cause the game to feel a little confusing for the player.
| The images take up way too much or way too little space in the game. They are not on a transparent background. The game feels confusing and jumbled as a result.

| Danger and Target Speed
| The danger and target move at appropriate speeds, causing the game play to be fun.
| The speed of the danger and/or target are slightly too fast or too slow, causing game play to be less fun.
| The speed of the danger and target are wrong, causing the game to be too difficult or too easy or very confusing – therefore not fun.

| Danger and Target Orientation
| The danger and target move in appropriate directions, causing the game play to be fun.
| The direction of the danger or target don't make sense, causing game play to be less fun.
| The direction of the danger and target don't make sense, causing the game to be confusing – therefore not fun.

| Onscreen Detection
| Onscreen detection is appropriate, allowing the danger and target to fly across the screen and return smoothly.
| The programmer needs to adjust the onscreen detection to improve game play / there is some “glitching” of the danger and target near the edge of the screen.
| The danger and target do not return when they go off screen.

| Player Movement
| The player moves at an appropriate speed, causing game play to be fun. Hitting a random key does not prevent the player from moving.
| The player's movement does not completely make sense, causing the game to be less fun. Hitting a random key produces an error.
| The player does not move at all.

| Collisions
| The collisions happen at appropriate times.
| The collisions happen slightly too early / late, when images are already overlapping or have not yet made contact.
| The timing of the collisions is way off, causing the game to feel confusing and disorienting.

| Code Quality
| The programmer provides contracts and clear purpose statements for each and every function. There are examples provided for every key press and for every "else" clause. There are no failed examples.
| Occasionally, the programmer forgets a contract or provides a confusing purpose statement. There is one failed example.
| Coding seems rushed, with frequent missing contracts and purpose statements. There are multiple failed examples.
