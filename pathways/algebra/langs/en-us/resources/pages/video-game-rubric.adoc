| Needs Improvement

| Title
| Both the title and the title color were customized.
| The title OR the title color was not customized.
| The title and title color were not customized.

| Images
| The images appropriately sized and face the right direction. They make sense in the game and it is easy to discern which image is the danger / target / player.
| The sizing of the images is slightly off and/or they face the wrong way. The images cause the game to feel a little confusing for the player.
| The images take up way too much or way too little space in the game. They are not on a transparent background. The game feels confusing and jumbled as a result.

| Danger and Target Movement
| The danger and target move at appropriate speeds and in appropriate directions, causing the game play to be fun.
| The speed and/or the direction of the danger and target are slightly too fast or too slow, causing game play to be less fun.
| The speed and direction of the danger and target are wrong, causing the game to be too difficult or too easy or very confusing – therefore not fun.

| Safe Zones
| The safe zones are appropriate, causing the danger and target to fly across the screen and return smoothly.
| The programmer needs to adjust the safe zones to improve game play / there is some “glitching” of the danger and target near the edge of the screen.
| The danger and target do not return when they go off screen.

| Collisions
| The collisions happen at appropriate times.
| The collisions happen slightly too early / late, when images are already overlapping or have not made contact yet.
| The timing of the collisions is way off, causing the game to feel confusing and disorienting.

| Failed Examples
| There are no failed examples.
| There is one failed example.
| There is more than one failed example.

| Projectile
| The projectile is appropriately sized and flies at an appropriate speed.
| The sizing and speed of the projectile are off.
| The incorrect sizing and speed of the projectile cause the game to feel confusing and less fun.
