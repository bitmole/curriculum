| *Title Page:* The student has included an appropriate title, as well as working links to the published Pyret file and the data source.
|  |  |
| *My Dataset:* The student has clearly articulated their reason for selecting the dataset. The dataset is thoroughly described, and the source of the data is also provided. Questions about the dataset demonstrate deep critical thinking, and the grouped samples created support analyzing these questions.
|  |  |
| *Categorical Visualizations:* The student has included two titled and labeled pie and/or bar charts. For both data displays, the student provides a compelling reason for making the graph and can describe compellingly what the displays convey.
|  |  |
| *Quantitative Visualizations:* The student has included at least one histogram. The axes are described and a title is provided. The student provides a compelling reason for making the histogram and can describe compellingly what the histogram conveys.
|  |  |
| *Measures of Center and Spread:* The student has analyzed at least two columns with all measures of center and spread addressed. Boxplots or five-number summaries accompany the findings. Outliers (or lack of) are discussed. The studentâ€™s written analysis demonstrates a clear understanding of what the graphs are conveying.
|  |  |
| *Correlations:* The student has included two titled and labeled scatterplots. If the scatterplot is roughly linear, the student has performed a linear regression. The student has interpreted the correlations correctly, and their written analysis demonstrates a clear understanding of what the graph is conveying.
|  |  |
| *Conclusions:* Conclusions to the findings were logical, demonstrated critical thinking, and explained how they can be used. Possible threats to validity were discussed, including what effect they could have. Questions for further research were shared.
