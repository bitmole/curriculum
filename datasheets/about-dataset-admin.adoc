Write a brief description of where this data comes from.
Examples:

- This dataset includes data from 271 Rhode Island public &
  charter schools.
- This data set looks at traffic stops in Durham, NC
  between 2002 and 2013, recording the number of them that resulted in searches of the person
  stopped. Data is broken down by age, race and sex.

:size:
[.question]
--
Write one of the following descriptors in the space below:

- This data set has a limited number of categories, making it
  accessible to any student.
- This data set has a huge number of columns that will excite
  some students and may overwhelm others.
--

:effort:
[.question]
--
Write one of the following descriptors in the space below:

- The columns of this data set are defined to allow students to
  start analysis without much additional coding.
- The columns of this data set require calculations to convert
  data before students start making graphs.
--

:col:
[.question]
*Column Titles:*
List columns below.

:fun:
[.question]
*Have students...*
--
Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
to deepen the analysis. For example:

- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
  black students at a school.
- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

:outliers-to-be-aware-of:
[.question]
*Heads Up*
--
If there are outliers teachers should be aware of, please note them below. For example:

- *Outliers to be aware of:* Only a few films are from before 2000.
- *Outlier to be aware of:* Classical High School has test scores of zero.
--

:calc:
[.question]
--
List any recommended calculations below. For example:

- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
  percentages would need to be calculated.
- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.
