Write a brief description of where this data comes from.
Examples:

- This dataset includes data from 271 Rhode Island public &
  charter schools. 
- This data set looks at how many traffic stops in Durham, NC

.Column Titles
List columns below.

:fun:

Have students:
Make a list of functions below that you would recommend defining
to deepen the analysis. For example:

- *define* a function pct-black, which computes the percent of
  black students at a school. 
- *define* a function high-math, which returns true if a school
  has more than 60% of students passing the state math test.

[.question]
List any outliers of note below.


:calc:
[.question]
--
List any recommended calculations below. For example:

- Other than ELA and Math Passing Percentages, columns list the
  number of students.  In order to compare between schools,
  percentages would need to be calculated.
- Free and Reduced lunch students are listed as two separate
  quantities. Usually we combine these numbers for analysis.
