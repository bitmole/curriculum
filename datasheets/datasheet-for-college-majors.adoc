== Composition

include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=39..47]
//
// _ :Comp-intro:
//
// Dataset creators should read through the questions in this
// section prior to any data collection and then provide answers
// once collection is complete. Most of these questions are intended
// to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
// make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific
// tasks. The answers to some of these questions reveal information
// about compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation
// (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.
//


include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=49..55]
//
// Required Question :comp-what:
//
// What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent
// (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple
// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a
// description.
//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.
The instances in this dataset represent people, residents of the United States.


include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=57..60]
//
// Required Question :comp-quantity:
//
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if
// appropriate)?
//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.
3,852,132 instances are included in this dataset. Although there are more
instances from the original American Community Survey data, only the ones
with information about college majors were included in this dataset.


include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=62..71]
//
// Required Question :comp-representativeness:
//
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.
The dataset is a sample of residents of the United States. It is a
representative sample, as the Census Bureau focuses on geographic
coverage when selecting participants for each month's American Community
Survey. In addition, the Census Bureau randomly selects participants over
every month, increasing representativeness when looking at data from five
years. Finally, the Census Bureau reduces response bias by following up
several times to ensure that everyone who receives the American Community
Survey actually completes it.


include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=73..77]

// Required Question :comp-content:
//
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please

Each instance consists of raw data, such as strings and numbers.

// missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include
// intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g.,
// redacted text.
//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.
Not all instances have information about their college majors, employment status,
and income levels as it was unavailable through the American Community Survey data.

//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.
Some college majors with median income calculations that were < $15,000
were removed as these would be below minimum wage and are likely due to
errors or insufficient data in the data collection process.
