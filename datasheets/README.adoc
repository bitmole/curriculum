= Datasheet

This directory contains two scripts `make-questionnaire.rkt` and
`sanitize.rkt`.

1) `make-questionnaire.rkt` takes a datasheet spec file, say
`D-dataset-admin.adoc`, and produces
a student-facing questionnaire file, `D-dataset-author.adoc`, that each student fills out.

It is allowed to rename these questionnaire files, especially if
many copies are generated, each presumably to filled differently
for a different dataset.
 

2) `expand-questionnaire.rkt` takes the _filled_ questionnaire
`D-dataset-author.adoc`
and produces a checked, expanded version
`D-dataset-final.adoc`, which can be transferred to the appropriate
pathway subdirectory. 

`expand-questionnaire.rkt` checks the filled questionnaire
against the original admin file. This latter file is embedded in
the questionnaire, so it does not matter if the questionnaire was
renamed.

The name of the final file can be changed by the answer to a
specific question with tag `:dataset-name`. If, e.g., the answer
to this question is `poodles`, and if the admin file is
`D-dataset-admin.adoc`, then the final file is named
`D-poodles.adoc`.

Some admin files are included:
`datasheet-for-dataset-admin.adoc` and `about-dataset-admin.adoc`
which are used for production, and some sample ones for testing.

A sample stylesheet `questionnaire.css` is used to test the HTML
versions locally. Typically, though, the final files are included
in the pathways and use the latter's stylesheets.


== Format of the `D-datasheet-admin.adoc` file

The `D-datasheet-admin.adoc` file contains a list of tags with the paragraph
that each tag expands to. E.g., a tag `Description` could be
defined as:

   :Description:
   These questions relate to the Frobbotz dataset. Your
   answers will help clarify what Frobbotz's benefits, demands,
   and consequences are.

All tags end with a blank line or end-of-file.  If the body of
the tag narrative should contain a blank line, as when
introducing an itemization, you may put the entire tag
narrative inside an open block, i.e., with “fence” lines that have a
leading `--` and nothing else. E.g.,

   :Description:
   --
   These questions relate to the Frobbotz dataset. Your
   answers will help clarify what Frobbotz's benefits, demands,
   and consequences are.

   - Question 1

   - Question 2
   --

(AsciiDoc needs a blank line (or beginning-of-file) above the
first item in order to recognize an itemization list.)

The `Description` tag above is a \fInot\fP
a question, so there is no expectation of an answer by the
student. 

Tags that are questions are characterized by a line immediately
following the tag mentioning the (CSS) class `[.question]`. E.g.,

    :origin:
    [.question]
    Where did the Frobbotz data come from?

Additional CSS classes `.required` and `.common` may be added in
the brackets for questions that cannot be skipped. `.common` is
used for those questions which can be answered with the symbol
`:common:`, whereby a common pre-stored answer is intended.

`:common:` questions must be followed by the default (“stock”) answer in the
admin file. The answer is given as a paragraph (or an open block of
pragraphs fenced with `--`) prefixed with

   [.answer]

In addition to these, the admin file
may contain other content. These, as also the stock questions
with their stock answers, are suppressed in the
generated questionnaire.

== The student-facing file, `D-dataset-author.adoc`

The command

    make-questionnaire.rkt D-dataset-admin.adoc

creates the corresponding student-facing questionnaire file,
`D-dataset-author.adoc`.

This file is a condensed copy of `D-dataset-admin.adoc` that is
used as a questionnaire. It is OK to rename this file before
issuing it to respondents, and also to rename the returned filled
questionnaire still further.

The tag definitions are converted tag inclusions, and
their values are given as AsciiDoc comments so that the student
can read them and enter the appropriate answer in the space
indicated. E.g., the tagged question `:origin:` above becomes

    include::D-dataset-admin.adoc[...]
    //
    // Question :origin:
    //
    // Where did the Frobbotz data come from?
    //


== Editing and submitting `D-dataset-author.adoc`

The student edits `D-dataset-author.adoc` (whatever its chosen name) using the text editor of their
choice. Answers are written in the spaces following the
questions.
The tag inclusion lines
should not be
tampered with.

== Sanitizing `D-dataset-author.adoc`

Running

    expand-questionnaire.rkt D-author.adoc

does a spot-check that edited file is clean, has all the answers
mandated, and removes the tag-inclusion, and creates a “final”
file that is independent, i.e., with all the includes of the
admin file fragments expanded out. This file can then be moved to
its desired place in 
the pathway directories.

`expand-questionnaire.rkt` uses the admin file, `D-dataset-admin.adoc`, to
ensure that all the guidelines and questions are re-inserted
correctly, and that all tags are present and answered, and are in the
right order. Cases of serious manglage are reported as failure,
so the file can be discarded as invalid.

If the questionnaire file is `D-author.adoc`, then the
final file named `D-final.adoc` by default. If the q file
basename doesn't
have the `-author` suffix, e.g., `B.adoc`, then the final file is
`B-final.adoc`.  If the first question in the q file is
`:dataset-name:`, then its answer `C` is used with the admin file
(`D-dataset-admin.adoc`) to fashion a final file named
`D-C.adoc`.

== Creating HTML report

Run Asciidoctor on the expanded file

    asciidoctor -a stylesheet=questionnaire.css D-final.adoc

to get a local HTML file that can be used to check the output.
Any stylesheet may be used. Ideally, it should contain a suitable
style for the class `.question`, so the questions stand out apart
from the student answers. 

`questionnaire.css` is used only for local checking.
After carting off the final files to the pathway directories, the
pathway build's stylesheets take over.

== Makefile

A `Makefile` is included for convenience:

    make questionnaires

generates a new `*-author.adoc` file for each of the
`*-admin.adoc` in the directory.

    make

generates HTML reports from all the `*-author.adoc` files in the
directory. It is assumed that these student files have all been
manually edited to reflect a student's answers.
