// Dataset creators should read through the questions in this

// to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to
// make informed decisions about using the dataset for specific

// types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and
// interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a

//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

Each instance represents a US state, with population and arrest data for the year 2018.

//
// Required Question :comp-quantity:
//
// How many instances are there in total (of each type, if

//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

There are 49 state listed (data was not available for Florida).

include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=62..71]

// Required Question :comp-representativeness:
 //
// Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a
// sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
// If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
// sample representative of the larger set(e.g., geographic
// coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was
// validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger
// set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range
// of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).
//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

The dataset includes nearly every possible instance with the exception of Florida, for which data
was not available. It also does not include the District of Columbia or any other US territories.

//
// Required Question :comp-content:
//
// What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g.,
// unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please
// provide a description.
//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

Each instance consists only of numbers and strings. The legalization year, decriminalization year,
and medical marijuana legalization year are all treated as strings, as some have multiple values
(indicated by a "/") and many have no value (indicated by the string "No").

// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, from which this data originates, uses data from 18,000 agencies
across the country. Participation in this program is voluntary, and some agencies refuse to participate. Data from missing
agencies was imputated by a method outlined in the ACLU report, but this is not 100% accurate. However, the majority of
agencies did participate, so this error is expected to be very small. A deeper analysis of the error sources is included 
within the ACLU report.

//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

The data was acquired from an ACLU research report entitled "A Tale of Two Countries - Racially Targeted arrests

The dataset could be used for essentially study of the relationship between the racial makeup of a population and
marijuana-related arrests, as well as comparing the impact of marijuana legalization and decriminalization on crime rates.

include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=365..375]

//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

The legalization dates listed are only true as of March 2020. Any future users should research recent marijuana legalization events 
and amend the dataset accordingly before performing an analysis.

Additionally, users should be aware that data for the state of Florida was not included, and remember to not generalize findings 
from this dataset to all 50 US states, as only 49 are represented.


include::datasheet-for-datasets-admin.adoc[lines=377..380]
//
// Required Question :use-dontuse:

// Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If

//
//
// PLEASE WRITE YOUR ANSWER BELOW THIS LINE.

The dataset only reflects values for 49 US states, and holds data for two races. It should not be treated as a general analysis
of worldwide marijuana use, as the laws, regulations, and culture surrounding marijuana use vary greatly by country. It should also
not be generalized to other races such as Latinxs.

Additionally, this data should not be used to imply any causality between the legalization of marijuana and any changes in arrest
rates. That sort of analysis would, at minimum, require the dataset to include data for each state both prior to and after the 
legalization of marijuana.
