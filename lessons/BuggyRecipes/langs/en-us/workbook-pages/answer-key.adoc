= Design Recipe Exercise Answer Key

.target-leap

1. First example should be 
+
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 100) (* 100 2))`

2. Second example should be 
+
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 40) (* 40 2))`

3. In the definition, the name of the function should be
`target-leap`

4. The variable name in the definition should be consistent
(either `x` or `x-coor`)

5. The body of the function definition should be `(* x-coor 2)`

.offscreen?

1. The Purpose Statement should include “return true is the coordinate is less
than -50 and greater than 690”

2. Both examples should show the work, not just the answer:
+
a. `(EXAMPLE (offscreen? 60) (or (< 60 -50) (> 60 690)))` 
+
b. `(EXAMPLE (offscreen? 800) (or (< 8000 -50) (> 800 690)))`

3. The function definition should use the function `or` instead of `and`

.calc-pencils

1. Both examples should multiply by 5

2. The variable should be more descriptive: s, or students, to represent the
number of students

.circle-area

1. The function body should be 
+
`(* (sqr (/ diameter 2)) (/ 22 7))`

.check-total

1. The examples should use the function name `check-total` instead
of `total`

2. Both Examples have too many parentheses for the function call:
+
`(EXAMPLE ( (total 20) ) ...)` should be `(EXAMPLE ( total 20
) ...)`

3. The `*` function must come before its inputs in the examples:
+
`(EXAMPLE ... (+ (* 0.20 56.67) 56.67))`

4. The function body should have the `*` and `+` functions
reversed:
+
`(+ (* 0.20 food-total) food-total)`


.enough-carpet?

1. The range of the functoin should be a boolean

2. The example inputs should not be in parentheses

3. Both the examples and the function definition should use `<=`
instead of `<`


.enough-cash?

1. The domain of the function should be a number (representing
the price), not a string

2. The two examples should give numbers as an input and test if
they are less than 1.50. For instance, `(EXAMPLE (enough-cash?
4.50) (<= 4.50 1.50))`

3. The variable name in the function body can be `item`, but a
more accurate name would be `price` or `cost`


.equal-length?

1. The function body should be
+
`(= (string-length string1) (string-length string2))`

.flower-name

1. The second example should be
+
`(EXAMPLE (flower-name "purple") "tulip")`

.long-name?

1. Both examples should use the function `string-length`, not `string=?`

2. The examples should check if the name is longer than 20 characters, not 10

3. The function name in the definition should be `long-name?`

4. The body of the function should be 
+
`(< (string-length name) 20)`

.scale-image

1. The purpose statement doesn't specify what strings matter, or
how much to scale by
+
The Examples do not use the scale function at all, and instead
change the parameters of the image. The first example should be:
+
----
(EXAMPLE (scale-image (circle 5 "solid" "red") "bigger")
         (scale 2 (circle 5 "solid" "red"))
----

2. The function name in the second example is incorrect

.state-tax

1. The domain for the function should be `String Number` to account for both
the state and the price of the item

2. The function name in both examples should be `state-tax`

3. The example inputs (“Delaware” and “Georgia”) should be Strings

4. Examples should include a numerical price instead of the variable name
`price`

5. The examples should use `*` not `+`

.late-to-class?

1. Both examples should include 4 numbers as inputs

2. In the first example, `<` should be used in place of `>`
