.target-leap

1. The first example doesn't work. It would work better as
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 100) (* 100 2))` or
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 100) (* 2 100))`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`target-leap(100) is 100 * 2` or
`target-leap(100) is 2 * 100`
endif::[]

2. The second example is incorrect according to the problem
   statement. It could be
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 40) (* 40 2))`  or
`(EXAMPLE (target-leap 40) (* 2 40))`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`target-leap(40) is 40 * 2` or
`target-leap(40) is 2 * 40`
endif::[]

3. In the definition, the name of the function should be
`target-leap`

4. The variable name in the definition should be consistent
(either `x` or `x-coor`)

5. The body of the function definition should be
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(* x-coor 2)`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`x-coor * 2`
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
.offscreen?
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
.is-offscreen
endif::[]

1. The Purpose Statement should include “return true is the coordinate is less
than -50 or greater than 690”

2. Both examples should show the work, not just the answer:
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
a. `(EXAMPLE (offscreen? 60) (or (< 60 -50) (> 60 690)))`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
a. `is-offscreen(60) is (60 < -50) or (60 > 690)`
endif::[]
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
b. `(EXAMPLE (offscreen? 800) (or (< 8000 -50) (> 800 690)))`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
b. `is-offscreen(800) is (800 < -50) or (800 > 690)`
endif::[]

3. In the definition, the function name should be
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`offscreen?` instead of `offscreen`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`is-offscreen` instead of `is-off-screen`
endif::[]

4. The function definition should use the function `or` instead of `and`

.calc-pencils

1. Both examples should multiply by 5

2. The variable should be more descriptive: s, or students, to represent the
number of students

3. In the definition, the function name should be `calc-pencils`

.circle-area

1. `pi` is not a built-in value, so it should be replaced with an
approximation such as `3.14` or
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(/ 22 7)`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`(22 / 7)`
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
2. If using
`(/ 22 7)`
for `pi`, the function body could be
+
`(* (sqr (/ diameter 2)) (/ 22 7))`
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
2. If using
`(22 / 7)`
for `pi`, the function body could be
+
`num-sqr(diameter / 2) * (22 / 7))`
endif::[]

.check-total

1. The examples should use the function name `check-total` instead
of `total`

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]

2. Both examples have too many parentheses for the function call

3. The `*` function must come before its inputs in the examples:
+
`(+ (* 0.20 56.67) 56.67))`

4. The function body should have the `*` and `+` functions
reversed:
+
`(+ (* 0.20 food-total) food-total)`
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]

2. Both examples have an extra input that isn't attached to an operator or function
+
`((0.2 * 20) + 20)`

3. The `*` operator must be used instead of `x` to show multiplication in the examples:
+
`((0.20 * 56.67) + 56.67)`

4. The function body should have the `*` and `+` operators
reversed:
+
`(0.20 * food-total) + food-total`
endif::[]

.enough-carpet?

1. The range of the function should be a Boolean

2. The example inputs should not be in an extra set of parentheses

3. Both the examples and the function definition should use `<=`
instead of `<`

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
4. The example inputs should be separated by a comma
endif::[]

.enough-cash?

1. The domain of the function should be a Number (representing
the price), not a String

2. The two examples should give numbers as an input and test if
they are less than 1.50. For instance,
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(EXAMPLE (enough-cash? 2.50) (<= 2.50 1.50))`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`enough-cash?(2.50) is 2.50 <= 1.50`
endif::[]

3. The variable name in the function body can be `item`, but a
more accurate name would be `price` or `cost`

.equal-length?

1. The function body should be
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(= (string-length string1) (string-length string2))`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`string-length(string1) == string-length(string2)`

2. The inputs in the examples should be in quotes - "yes", "no"
endif::[]

.flower-name

1. The purpose statement should read "Takes in the color and returns the name of that flower"

2. The second example should be
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(EXAMPLE (flower-name "purple") "tulip")`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`flower-name("purple") is "tulip"`

3. In the examples, all the colors and flower names should be Strings, written inside quotation marks.
endif::[]

.long-name?

1. Both examples should use the function `string-length`, not
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`string=?`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`string-equal`
endif::[]

2. The examples should check if the name is longer than 20 characters, not 10

3. The function name in the definition should be `long-name?`

4. The body of the function should be
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`(< (string-length name) 20)`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`string-length(name) < 20`
endif::[]

.scale-image

1. The purpose statement doesn't specify which strings matter, or
how much to scale by
+
The examples do not use the `scale` function at all, and instead
change the parameters of the image. The first example should be:
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
----
(EXAMPLE (scale-image (circle 5 "solid" "red") "bigger")
         (scale 2 (circle 5 "solid" "red"))
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
----
scale-image(circle(5, "solid", "red"), "bigger") is
         scale(2, circle(5, "solid", "red"))
----
endif::[]

2. The function name in the second example is incorrect

.state-tax

1. The domain for the function should be
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`String Number`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`String, Number`
endif::[]
 to account for both
the state and the price of the item

2. The function name in both examples should be `state-tax`

3. The example inputs (“Delaware” and “Georgia”) should be Strings

4. Examples should include a numerical price instead of the variable name
`price`

5. The examples should use `*` not `+`

6. The function variable name should not contain spaces and must be consistent throughout the function definition. It should instead be `price`

.late-to-class?

1. Both examples should include 4 numbers as inputs

2. In the first example, `<` should be used in place of `>`

3. Both examples and the function definition should calculate distance based on the 4 inputs, such as
+
`late-to-class(40, 55, 80, 100) is 25 < distance(40, 55, 80, 100)`

4. The two examples should be different from each other.  Since the function returns a Boolean, good practice would be to make one example that is true and another that is false
