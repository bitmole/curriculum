= Defining Functions

@lesson-description{Students discover functions as an abstraction over a programming pattern, and are introduced to a structured approach to building them called the Design Recipe.}

[@lesson-intro-table]
|===
@prereqs-stds{alg-defining-values}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* describe the usefulness of @vocab{functions}.
* create their own functions and @vocab{examples} given the constraints of a problem.
* define one-argument functions that consume a Number and produce an Image
* define one-argument functions that consume a String and produce an Image
* define one-argument functions that consume a Row and produce an Image


| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain why a function is useful.
* I can write my own function in @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme} @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret}.

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs


| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* This lesson represents a _big_ shift in thinking.  After some practice, students will not be limited to pre-existing functions!
* Take plenty of time for the @vocab{Design Recipe} as students will return to it frequently in future lessons.

== Looking for Repeated Patterns @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
@ifpathway{algebra, ok}{
Students have already searched for structure in a list of expressions in order to define values.
}
In this lesson, students will build their flexibiltiy of thinking by engaging with multiple representations. Students will search for structures that are _dynamic_, meaning they change in a predictable way. This is the foundation for defining functions.

=== Launch

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }
on their computer.

@centered-image{images/ILoveGreenTriangles.jpg, I Love Green Triangles, 400, align="center"}

@centered-image{images/GreenTriangle.jpg, I Love Green Triangles, 400, align="center"}

This is a fun lesson to make silly! Dramatically confess to your students, "I LOVE green triangles!" Challenge them to use the Definitions Area to code as many unique, solid, green triangles as they can in 2 minutes.

Walk around the room and give positive feedback on the green triangles.  After the time is up, ask for some examples of green triangles that they wrote and copy them to the board.  Be specific and attend to precision with the @vocab{syntax} such that students can visually spot the pattern between the different lines of code.

[.indentedpara]
--
For example:

@show{(sexp->code '(triangle  30  "solid" "green"))}

@show{(sexp->code '(triangle  12  "solid" "green"))}

@show{(sexp->code '(triangle 500  "solid" "green"))}
--

- *Is there a pattern?*
_Yes, the code mostly stayed the same with one change each time._

- *What stayed the same?*
_The function name `triangle`, "solid", "green"._

- *What changed?*
_The size of the `triangle`, or the Number input._

[.lesson-instruction]
--
@ifpathway{algebra, ok}{

We've learned how to define *values* when we want to create a shortcut to reuse the same code over and over.

For example:
@show{(sexp->code '(define PRIZE-STAR (star 65 "solid" "pink")))}

*But to make a shortcut that _changes_ such as creating solid, green triangles of a changing size, we need to define a _function_.*
}

Suppose we want to define a shortcut @vocab{function} called `gt`. When we give it a number, it makes a solid green triangle of whatever size we give it.
--

Select a student to _act out_ `gt`. Make it clear to the class that their Name is "gt", they expect a Number, and they will produce an Image. Act out some examples before having the class add their own and record them on the board:


- You say: *gt 20!*
The student responds: _@show{(sexp->code '(triangle 20 "solid" "green"))}!_
- You say: *gt 200!*
The student responds: _@show{(sexp->code '(triangle 200 "solid" "green"))}!_
- You say: *gt 99!*
The student responds: _@show{(sexp->code '(triangle 99 "solid" "green"))}!_

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Just as we were able to give our volunteer instructions that let them take in `gt 20` and give us back @show{(sexp->code '(triangle 20 "solid" "green"))}, we can define any function we'd like in the *Definitions Area*.  We need to program the computer to be as smart as our volunteer. But how do we do that?


We already know how to do this in math!

@centered-image{images/math-function.png, 400, align="center"}

In this table of values, we add 3 to whatever number is in the left column.  How would we describe the function being used to generate this table of values?

@centered-image{images/math-fun-def.png, 400, align="center"}

In @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret}, that would look like:

@centered-image{images/math-fun-def-pyret.png, 400, align="center"}

Let's look at the examples we just came up with for `gt`.

@centered-image{images/examples-pyret.png, 400, align="center"}

[.lesson-instruction]
In the case of `gt`, the domain was a number and that number stood for the `size` of the triangle we wanted to make. Whatever number we gave `gt` for the size of the triangle is the number our volunteer inserted into the `triangle` function. Everything else stayed the same no matter what!  We need to define `gt` in terms of the variable `size`, instead of in terms of a specific number.

Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/match-examples-functions.adoc} and look at the definition of `gt` in the first row of the table.
--
@ifproglang{pyret}{
@centered-image{images/gt-fun-pyret.png, 400, align="center"}
}

[.lesson-instruction]
Using `gt` as a model, match the mystery function examples to their corresponding definitions.

|@span{.title}{Connecting to Best Practices}

- Writing the examples is like "showing your work" in math class.

- Have students circle what is changing and label it with a proper variable name.  The name of the variable should reflect what it represents, such as `size`.

- Writing examples and identifying the variables lays the groundwork for writing the function, which is especially important as the functions get more complex.  Don't skip this step!
|===

=== Synthesize
[.lesson-instruction]
- What strategies did you use to match the @vocab{examples} with the @vocab{function definitions}?
- Why is defining functions useful to us as programmers?

== Examples and Contracts

=== Launch

* What is the contract for `triangle`?

[.indentedpara]
--
`triangle {two-colons} Number, String, String -> Image`
--

* What is the contract for `gt`? _A Number_

[.indentedpara]
--
`gt {two-colons} Number -> Image`
--

* Why might someone think the domain for `gt` contains a Number and two Strings? _The function `gt` only needs one Number input because that's the only part that's changing. The function `gt` makes use of `triangle`, whose Domain is Number String String, but `gt` already knows what those strings should be._

=== Investigate

Let's practice identifying the patterns in examples and using them to write contracts!

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{pages/create-contracts-examples1.adoc}. If you have time, you may also want to have students complete @ifproglang{wescheme}{
@opt-online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/607b618988b17d447fe159e8, FIX & publish THIS before it goes live}
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
@opt-online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5fc9328d18307e2e492ca0d8, Matching Examples & Contracts}
}.

=== Synthesize

Have students turn to a partner and compare the contracts they've written.
[.lesson-instruction]
- What strategies did you use to identify the contracts?
- Were any of the contracts trickier to write than others?

WONDERING IF MAYBE THIS WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE AS A MATCHING ACTIVITY?


- *Functions can consume values besides Numbers. What did sticker consume?*

- How did you define a function in @ifproglang{WeScheme}{WeScheme} @ifproglang{Pyret}{Pyret}?

The Design Recipe is a powerful tool for solving word problems. In this lesson, students practiced using it on simple _programming problems_, but soon they'll be applying it to traditional math problems. Encourage them to make this connection on their own: can they think of a math problem in which this would be useful?

=== other fragments that might be useful...


Other options include:
*Word Problem: Write a function called `gold-star` that takes in a number and produces a solid, gold star of that given size.*
Write 2 examples and the definition of `gold-star` on the 'Fast Functions' handout.


To build our own functions, we’ll use a series of steps called the @vocab{Design Recipe}. The Design Recipe is a way to think through the behavior of a function, to make sure we don’t make any mistakes! The Design Recipe has three steps, and we’ll go through them together for our first function.

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{pages/design-recipe-1.adoc}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- On the top half of the page you will see the contract, examples, and function defintion for `gt`. Type them into the Definitions Area (Contract, Examples and Definition!), click *Run* and evaluate @show{(sexp->code '(gt 10))} in the Interactions Area.
- What did you get back? _a little green triangle!_
- Try changing one of the examples to be incorrect and click run again. What happens?
_The editor lets us know that the function doesn't match the examples so that we can fix our mistake!_


[.lesson-instruction]
Using `gt` as a model, complete the contract, examples and function defintion for `bc`.  Then type the Contract, Purpose Statement, Examples and Definition into the Definitions Area, click “Run”, and make sure all of the examples pass!

Then have them turn to @printable-exercise{pages/design-recipe-2.adoc} and complete the @vocab{Design Recipe} for `dot` and `sticker`.

If you have time, ask students to
[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Design a problem for a function that takes in one input and returns a shape that uses that input. Your
function's input could be a Number, as in the two examples, or a String.
- Write two examples and a definition for your function
