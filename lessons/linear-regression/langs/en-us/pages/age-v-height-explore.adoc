= Age vs. Height Explore

Open the @starter-file{height} and click run.

@n Take a look at the code in the Definitions Area. What do you notice? What do you wonder?

@vspace{10ex}

@n Build `image-scatter-plot(h-table, "age", "height", dot)`.  Try to visualize the line of best fit for just the blue dots. Then try to visualize the line of best fit for just the red stars. How do you think they would compare? Which line do you think would be steeper? Do the points lead back toward the same y-intercept or do you expect one line to start higher than the other? ALTERNATIVELY WE COULD ASK What new information do you learn from this display?

@ifsoln{_Answers will vary_}
@vspace{5ex}



@n Now build `lr-plot(h-table.filter(is-f), "gender-id", "age", "height")`.

[cols="^1,^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| predictor function 		| rate of change			| y-intercept				
| @ifsoln{_48 in_}			| @ifsoln{_65 in_} 			| 	@ifsoln{_48 in_}	
@vspace{5ex}
|=== 



@n Now build `lr-plot(h-table.filter(is-m), "gender-id", "age", "height")`.

[cols="^1,^1,^1", options="header"]
|===
| predictor function 		| rate of change			| y-intercept				
| @ifsoln{_48 in_}			| @ifsoln{_65 in_} 			| @ifsoln{_48 in_}

@n What makes it difficult to compare these two plots visually?
@ifsoln{_The axes are labelled differently_}

@vspace{8ex}

Rebuild `lr-plot(h-table.filter(is-f), "gender-id", "age", "height")`, adjust the window of the interactive plot so that:

[cols="^1,^1,^1,^1" options="header"]
|===
| x-min: 	| x-max:	| y-min:	| y-max:
| 6.5		| 12.5 		| 	40		| 70
|===
and click `ReDraw`.

Then, rebuild `lr-plot(h-table.filter(is-m), "gender-id", "age", "height")`, make the same adjustments and click `ReDraw`.

@n How do the two plots compare now that their windows match?
