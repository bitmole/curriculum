@n About how many inches are kids in this dataset expected to grow per year? @fitb{5em}{@showsoln{_3 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a child were 45" tall at age eight, how tall would you expect them to be at age 12? @fitb{5em}{@showsoln{_57 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n At that rate, if a ten-year-old were 55" tall at age 11, how tall would you expect them to have been at age 9? @fitb{5em}{@showsoln{_49 inches_}}

@vspace{1ex}

@n Using the equation, how tall would you expect a seven-year-old child to be? @fitb{5em}{@showsoln{_46.6 inches_}}

@vspace{5ex}

@n How many of the seven-year-olds are actually that height? @fitb{5em}{@showsoln{_zero!_}}

@n Use the equation, determine the expected height of someone who is...

@n Which ages does it make the most sense to determine using the linear regression equation? Why?

@showsoln{_The ages that fall within the range of the dataset. Note: Because this data was collected such that age does not include months, it may not make sense to attempt to break age down in smaller increments. Specifically, it appears that 7.5-year-olds would be included in the population of kids who were counted in the 7-year-old data._}

@n Which ages does it make the least sense to determine using the linear regression equation? Why?
@showsoln{_The regression might still work for extrapolating the height of a 6-year-old or a 13-year-old, since they are just beyond the range of the dataset, but it makes no sense to use this equation to figure out the height of a 90-year-old or babies, because humans don't grow at a constant rate for their entire life!_}
