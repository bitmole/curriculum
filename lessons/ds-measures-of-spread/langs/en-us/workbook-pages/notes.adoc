= Measures of Spread

// use double-space before the *bold* text to address a text-kerning bug in wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)
- Data Scientists can also measure the  *spread* of a dataset using a  *five-number summary*:

** The *minimum* – the smallest value in the dataset

** The *first, or “lower” quartile (Q1)* – the middle of the smaller half of values
which separates the smallest quarter from the next smallest quarter.

** The *second quartile (Q2)* – the median value which separates the entire
dataset into “top” and “bottom” halves.

** The *third, or “upper” quartile (Q3)* – the middle of the larger half of values
which separates the second largest quarter from the largest quarter.

** The *maximum* – the largest value in the dataset.

- The *five-number summary* can be used to draw a *box-and-whisker plot*.
