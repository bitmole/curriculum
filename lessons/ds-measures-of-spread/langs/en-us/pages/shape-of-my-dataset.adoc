= Shape of My Dataset

1) The column I chose to measure is @fitb{45ex}{}.


== Measures of Center
--
The three measures for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

| @span{.vskip}{} ||
|===
--

2) Since the mean is @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[higher/lower]} than the median, this suggests there may be outliers or skewness due to values that are unusually @fitbruby{30ex}{}{[high/low]}.

== Measures of Spread
--
My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Q2 (Median) | Q3 | Maximum

| @span{.vskip}{} ||||

A box plot can be drawn from this summary on the number line below

@span{.blankline}{}




From this summary and box plot, I conclude:
