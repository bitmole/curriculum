// use double-space before the *bold* text to address a text-kerning bug in wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)
Consider the following dataset, representing the annual income of ten people (note: $65k means $65,000, etc.):

  $65k, $12k, $14k, $280k, $15k, $22k, $45k, $34k, $45k, $175k

1) In the space below, rewrite this dataset in  *sorted order*.

__$12k, $14k, $15K, $22k, $34k, $45k, $45k, $65k, $175k, $280k__

2) In the table below, compute the  *measures of center* for this dataset.

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options='header']
|===
| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)
| $70.7k 		 | $39.5k | $45k
|===

3) In the table below, compute the  *five number summary* of this dataset.

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options='header']
|===

| Minimum | Q1	| Q2 (Median) | Q3 	| Maximum

| $12k	  | $15k| $39.5 	  | $65k| 	$280k
|===

4) On the number line below, draw a  *box plot* for this dataset.

5) The following statements are _correct_ ... but misleading. Write down the reason why.

[cols="2a,5a"]

|===
| Statement | Why it’s misleading

| “They’re rich! The average person makes more than $70k dollars!” 
| The mean is easily manipulated by a few outliers. For a dataset with this skew, median would have been a better measure.

| “It’s a middle-income list: the most common salary is $45k/yr!” 
| This is true, but mode should rarely be used for quantitative data with as much variability as this. The fact that $45k appears _twice_ doesn't tell us enough information about the shape for this claim to be valid.

| “This group is really diverse, with people making as little as 12k and as much as $280k!”
| Two datapoints - especially the extremes! - should not be used to make a claim about shape.
