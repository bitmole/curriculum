Read the following 5 contracts carefully:

----
A.  is-capital :: (city :: String, state :: String) -> Boolean
B.  show-score :: (team1 :: String, team2 :: String) -> Number
C.  is-capital :: (city :: String, pop :: Number) -> Boolean
D.  show-score :: (team :: String, score :: Number) -> Image
E.  is-capital :: (city :: String) -> Boolean
----

For each of the expressions below, indicate which contract (Aâ€“E)
describes the function being used.
