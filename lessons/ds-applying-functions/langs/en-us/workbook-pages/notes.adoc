= Applying Functions

We can use *functions* (like `num-sqr`, `num-sqrt` `triangle`, `star`, `string-repeat`, etc.) by writing the function name first, followed by a list of *arguments* in parentheses. For example: `star(50, "solid", "red")`.

Functions have *contracts*, which help explain how a function should be used. Every contract has three parts:
	. The _Name_ of the function - literally, what it's called.
	. The _Domain_ of the function - what _types of values_ the function consumes, and in what order.
	. The _Range_ of the function - what _type of value_ the function produces.
