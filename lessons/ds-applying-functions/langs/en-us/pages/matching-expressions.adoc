= Matching Expressions and Contracts

Read the following 5 contracts carefully:

----
A.  make-id :: (name :: String, age :: Number) -> Image
B.  phone-bill :: (minutes :: Number, texts :: Number) -> Number
C.  phone-bill :: (minutes :: Number) -> Number
D.  make-id :: (first :: String, last :: String) -> Image
E.  make-id :: (first :: String, last :: String, age :: Number) -> Image
----

For each of the expressions below, indicate which contract (Aâ€“E)
describes the function being used.
