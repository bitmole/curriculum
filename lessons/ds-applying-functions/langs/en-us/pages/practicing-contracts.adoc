= Contracts

Consider the following contract:

----
rotate :: (degree :: Number, img :: Image) -> Image
----

What is the *Name* of this function? @fitb{15em}{}

How may things are in this function's  *Domain*? @fitb{10em}{}

What is the *type* of this function's  *first argument*?
@fitb{10em}{}

What is the *name* of this function's  *second argument*?
@fitb{10em}{}

What is the *Range* of this function? @fitb{15em}{}.

Below, circle which expression is the correct application of this function, based on its contract.

1. `rotate(45, 90)`

2. `rotate(circle(99, "solid", "green"))`

3. `rotate(25, rectangle(7, 10, "outline", "black"))`

4. `rotate(rectangle(7, 10, "outline", "black"), 25)`
