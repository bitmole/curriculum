== Creating a Transform Transformer

@n Now select `Transform Attribute` in the Transformer plugin.

@n Enter `transform-is-young` as the name. This Transformer will replace all ages less than 5 with Boolean `true`.

@n Select the Animals Dataset.

@n What would be an appropriate name for our altered attribute?
@span{.blankline}{@ifsoln{`Young`. Note: Students can select the attribute name `Age` on their table and reame it `Young`.}}

@n Examine the contract. A domain is provided (row), but not a range. What is the desired output for `transform-is-young`? Remember to use a datatype.
@span{.blankline}{@ifsoln{`Boolean`}


@n Let's write a purpose statement. Whta do you think we want a Transformer called `transform-is-young` to do?
@span{.blankline}{@ifsoln{Creates a new table where ages below 5 are replaced with an indication of whether the animal is young or not.}}

@n Enter `Age < 5` as the expression.

@n Apply the Transformer. To define the Transformer for future use, select `Save`.

== More Transforming

@n Now, try creating a Transformer called `weight-in-kg`.
