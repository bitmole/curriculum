= Summarizing Columns in `Animals`

1) The column I choose to measure is 
@span{.fitb}{pounds}.


== Measures of Center

The three measures for this column are:


[cols='3']
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

|||
|===


2) Since the mean is @span{.fitb}{ higher / lower } than the median, this suggests that there may
be outliers or skewness due to values that are unusually
@span{.fitb}{ high / low }.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:


[cols='5']
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Q2 (Median) | Q3 | Maximum

|||||
|===


A box plot can be drawn from this summary on the number line below:

@span{.blankline}{}

From this summary and box-plot, I conclude:

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}
