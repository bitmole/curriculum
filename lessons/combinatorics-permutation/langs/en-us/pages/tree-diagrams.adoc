1) The Lopez family loves to go camping. So, each year Grandma buys Savannah and Rosa new gear. This year theyâ€™re getting camping mugs. They are available in 5 colors: green, blue, red, silver and copper. Draw the tree-diagram for all possible mug permutations, if Grandma chooses a mug for one girl and then the other.
