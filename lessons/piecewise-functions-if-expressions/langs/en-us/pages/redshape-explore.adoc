@n Open the

@ifproglang{wescheme}{@link{https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=3R59t8bocG, Red Shape starter file}}, and read through the code you find there. This code contains new programming that you haven't seen yet! Take a moment to list everything you Notice, and then everything you Wonder...

| *Notice* 		| *Wonder*
| @ifsoln{_(sample responses) I notice a contract and a purpose statement. I see examples.  I notice what looks like a function definition, but I see if/else in there_}
| @ifsoln{(sample responses) I wonder what if/else are all about...}

@n Add *another example* for "square".

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`red-shape("square") is square(20 "solid" "red")`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`(EXAMPLE (red-shape "square") (square 20 "solid" "red"))`}
}
@vspace{2ex}

@n Add another line of code to the definition, to define what the function should do with the input "square".

@ifsoln{
@ifproglang{pyret}{`else if (shape == "square"): square(20 "solid" "red")`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`[(string=? shape "square") (square 20 "solid" "red")]`}
}

@n Come up with some new shapes, and add them to the code. Make sure you include examples!

@ifsoln{_(depends on student choice - look for missing quotes, new lines in the definition without lines in the examples, etc.)_}

@n In your own words, describe how _piecewise functions_ work in this programming environment.
