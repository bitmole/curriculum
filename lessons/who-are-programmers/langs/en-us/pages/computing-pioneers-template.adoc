CEO OF APPLE INC.

[.text]
Tim Cook has been the CEO of apple since 2011 and is responsible for Apple investing in flash memory, which eventually led to the development of the iPad and the iPhone. Before joining Apple, Cook studied industrial engineering and business administration and worked for IBM and then Intelligent Electronics for 12 years. He is the first and only openly gay CEO on the Fortune 500 list. In 2015, Cook explained his decision to come out publicly, saying, "Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth."
