= Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics Poster Library

Dear Teachers,
We are excited to share a downloadable poster set of inspiring innovators for your classroom walls. We have worked hard to describe these pioneers' contributions in language that will resonate with and be accessible to the young people you work with. We intend to continue expanding this library and encourage you to check back at @link{bootstrapworld.org} for updates or to follow us on social media `@bootstrapworld` for announcements about new releases.

Our initial goal was to produce a black and white poster set, to make it as easy as possible for teachers to print these posters, but we have yet to find a black and white filter that does justice to images of people of color. If you have a photo processing program to suggest, please let us know at @link{contact@bootstrapworld.org}!
