Guillermo Camarena

[.title]
Electrical Engineer, Inventor

[.text]
In 1939, Guillermo Gonzalez Camarena independently developed the first Trichromatic Field Sequential System for color transmission for television, which was based on three colors - red, green and blue. He patented his color television system in 1940, at age 23. During his childhood in Mexico, Camarena loved to tinker and invent toys powered by electricity - including a radio transmitter at age 8 and a hobby radio at age 12. Camarena also loved music and folklore, and in fact composed his own songs. His best-known song is called "Rio Colorado," and the royalties he collected for it allowed him to develop his color TV system.
