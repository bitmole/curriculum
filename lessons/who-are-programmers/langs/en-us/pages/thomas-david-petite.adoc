Thomas David Petite

[.title]
Inventor, Wireless Mesh Networks

[.text]
Petite is one of the early inventors of wireless mesh networks, which allow our cell phones and other wireless devices to communicate. Growing up in Atlanta, his father (who had been a Chief of the Chippewa tribe in Wisconsin) educated him on his cultural heritage, instilling strong values and pride in his background. Petite founded the Native American Intellectual Property Enterprise Council, which helps indigenous inventors nationally. In describing his past, he has written about how dyslexia and his short attention span were "mental challenges that have helped me to become who I am today, a downright stubborn American Indian Inventor that happens to be a business junkie, Innovator with over 100 patents worldwide."
