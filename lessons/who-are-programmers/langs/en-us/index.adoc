= Programmers and what do they do

@description{Students learn about a diverse group of programmers through a short film and a gallery walk of our Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics poster series.}

@lesson-prereqs{}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will understand that:

* There are programmers who look like them and that they can relate to
* Programming is creative and collaborative
* Programming is useful in a wide range of fields
* People who wrote the programs we use every day started out writing quite basic programs
* There are lots of programming jobs, but not enough programmers to fill them

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I understand that programming is connected to things that impact my life and things that I care about.
* I understand that programmers come from diverse backgrounds and work in a wide range of fields.
* I know about some computer engineers and their contributions.
* I understand that I can be a programmer if I choose to put my mind to it.

| Preparation
|
* Print a set of Pioneers in Computing and Math Posters and prep them for a gallery walk. If this isn't feasible for your class, figure out how you will share the file with students and what structure you will use to engage them with it.
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs

== The people behind the programs we use

=== Overview
Students watch a 5-minute clip, hearing from programmers about how they got their start and seeing some of their projects and work environments. Then, students engage in a gallery walk of computing pioneers, selecting one to introduce to the class. Finally, students reflect on how what they've seen connects to their own identify and also helps them to understand the broader world.

=== Launch @duration{15 minutes}
[.lesson-instruction]
We're going to watch a short clip and then share what we noticed and wondered. You will have a few minutes to write down your thoughts when the film finishes. If you are someone who likes to write things down while you're watching something, you can turn to  @opt-printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc} now.

Play @online-exercise{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc, What Most Schools Don't Teach}.

[.lesson-instruction]
Take a few minutes to write down what you @opt-printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc}. "Notice"s should be statements, not questions - What stood out to you? What do you remember?

Crowdsource students' Notices and Wonders.

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note: Notice and Wonder!}

This pedagogy has a @link{https://www.learning-space.org/Page/96, rich grounding in literature}, and is used throughout this course. In the "Notice" phase, students are asked to crowd-source their observations. No observation is too small or too silly! By listening to other students' observations, students may find themselves taking a closer look. The "Wonder" phase involves students raising questions, but they must also explain the context for those questions. Sharon Hessney (moderator for the NYTimes excellent @link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's going on in this Graph?} activity) sometimes calls this "what do you wonder...and *why*?". Both of these phases should be done in groups or as a whole class, with adequate time given to each.

=== Investigate @duration{25minutes}
[.lesson-instruction]
There are posters of people who work in Computing and Math around the room. Take 5 minutes to move clockwise around the room and find the poster of someone who interests you. Spread out so you don't have too many people crowding around any one poster!

=== Synthesize @duration{15 minutes}
[.lesson-instruction]
Take 5 minutes on your own to complete @opt-printable-exercise{windows-mirrors.adoc}, writing about the poster of your choice.

We are going to take turns sharing your mirrors and windows with your partners. Share what feels comfortable. You do not have to read what you wrote. Each of you will get a minute to share your mirrors, then a minute to share your windows. If you finish before it's time to switch, leave space for the person whose turn it is to think and decide if they have anything else to add. You'll have time to discuss after you've both had two turns to speak. Decide which of you will go first and raise your hand when you're ready.

[.lesson-instruction]
* Whichever of you is sharing first, you now have one minute to share your mirrors. If it is not your turn to speak, please just listen. You will also have a turn to speak after your partner finishes.
* It's time to switch. The second speaker now has one minute to share your mirrors.
* It's time to switch. The first speaker now has one minute to share your windows.
* It's time to switch. The second partner now has one minute to share your windows.
* Thank you for taking turns listening. You now have 3 minutes to discuss and ask each other followup questions.

@link{https://nationalseedproject.org/itemid-fix/entry/curriculum-as-window-and-mirror?highlight=WyJ3aW5kb3dzIiwibWlycm9ycyJd, Curriculum as Window and Mirror} was first published by Emily Style, founding co-director of @link{https://nationalseedproject.org/, the National SEED Project (Seeking Educational Equity and Diversity)} in 1988 and remains a key piece that informs the work of SEED leaders to create reflective and inclusive classrooms and communities. This lesson only begins to tap into the power of the practice.
