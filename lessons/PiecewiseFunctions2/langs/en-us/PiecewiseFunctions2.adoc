|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Apply previous knowledge of piecewise functions to a new problem situation

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can write a function using conditionals to move my player

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Encourage students to challenge themselves when creating update-player by completing one of the extension activities.
* The update-player function is one of the main places where students can set their game apart and make it theirs.  Encourage exploration and experimentation!

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
* Students should be familiar with the Design Recipe for conditionals.
