= Piecewise Functions 2 

@lesson-description{Students apply their knowledge of piecewise functions to write a function to move the player in their game.}

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Apply previous knowledge of piecewise functions to a new problem situation.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can write a function using conditionals to move my player.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Encourage students to challenge themselves when creating update-player by completing one of the extension activities.
* The update-player function is one of the main places where students can set their game apart and make it theirs.  Encourage exploration and experimentation!
* Adding comments to code - if you have to ask a student "What are you trying to do there?", then they probably need more comments!  

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
* Students should be familiar with the Design Recipe for conditionals.

|Materials
|
* Lesson slides template (@link{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u0Zg-ErvH4ICRewgDeT42hnWngMrxPM1QwGSm8_FW-E/edit?usp=sharing, Google Slides})
* Design Recipe: update-player (@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/PiecewiseFunctions2-EX1.adoc, PDF})

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, workbook, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

Connect The Dots - Students think of what they did in the Luigi's Pizza lesson specifically, then generalize those concepts.  Finally, students think of how those concepts might be applied to their game.  
  

== Explore: (5 min)

Students open their *Game Project file* and look for where a conditional function would be necessary, then figure out what the contract represents.

MLR 6 - Three Reads: Have students read through the problem statement three times, looking for different information.  What is the problem asking me?  What is the contract for this function?  What information do I need to create that function?
****

== Discuss: (10 min)

* *What is the contract for `update-player`?*
+
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
_``update-player: Number String -> Number``_
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
_``update-player: Number, String -> Number``_
endif::[]
* *What does each part of the domain and range represent?*
+
_Domain: the Number is the y-coordinate of `PLAYER`, the String is the key that the user pressed; Range: the Number is the new y-coordinate of `PLAYER`_
* *What should happen mathematically to the y-coordinate of `PLAYER` when the user presses the "up" key?*
+
_It should increase, the program should add something to it_

== Practice: (15 min) 

Students complete @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/PiecewiseFunctions2-EX1.adoc, Design Recipe: update-player} with a partner, then type their code into their *game file* and test.  

== Create/Apply: (15 min)

Students choose one or more features to make their game more unique. 

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Reminder: Use `;` to add comments to code!
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Reminder: Use `#` to add comments to code!
endif::[]
Adding useful comments to code is an important part of programming. 

Some ideas for features:

* Warping - program one key to "warp" the player to a set location, such as the center of the screen
* Boundaries - change `update-player` such that `PLAYER` cannot move off the top or bottom of the screen 
* Wrapping - add code to `update-player` such that when `PLAYER` moves to the top of the screen, it reappears at the bottom, and vice versa
* Hiding - add a key that will make `PLAYER` seem to disappear, and reappear when the same key is pressed again
