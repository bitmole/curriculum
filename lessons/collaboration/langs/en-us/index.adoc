= Collaboration

@description{Students practice using the Design Recipe through a variety of collaborative exercises that allow them to interact with each other's work and receive feedback from peers, ultimately helping them to internalize the importance of attending to precision at each step of the way.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Understand how to use the @vocab{Design Recipe} to break down simple word problems.
* Create a strong @vocab{purpose statement} that details in their own words what the @vocab{function} is doing.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the Design Recipe to break down word problem when writing a function.
* I can identify @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and other quantities in a word problem when writing a function.
* I can create and revise a strong purpose statement that explains what the function is doing.

| Preparation
| Decide on groups of 3 and print copies of the word problems that you will be using for Design Recipe Telephone

* The purpose statement, like the contract, is a comment - something that the computer doesn't read.  It's important for readability of their code - there may be other people looking at their code and using their functions!
* The domain and range of a function are described as @vocab{data types}, such as Number, String, or Image.
* This activity can work well as a formative review.
* This activity is a good time to get students working with someone other than their usual coding partner.

== Design Recipe Telephone

Divide the class into groups of three. In every group, each student is given their own word problem (_we'll call them Problems A, B and C_).

@n *Student 1 writes the Contract and Purpose for Problem A*, Student 2 writes the Contract and Purpose for Problem B, Student 3 writes the Contract and Purpose for Problem C.

* _Once they're done, students should get rid of the word problems by handing them back to the teacher, folding them over, etc._

* Have students pass their paper to the right so that Student 1 is now looking at the Contract and Purpose for Problem C, Student 2 is looking at the Contract and Purpose for Problem A, and Student 3 is looking at Problem B.

@n *Based _solely on the Contract and Purpose_, each student must now write two Examples, as well as circle and label what is changing.*

* _Once they're done, students get rid of the Contract and Purpose by folding them over._

* If the Contract and Purpose don't provide enough information, they pass the paper back and the original author has to re-do them.

* Have students pass their paper to the right _again_, so that Student 1 is now looking at the Examples for Problem B, Student 2 is looking at the Contract and Purpose for Problem C, and Student 3 is looking at Problem A.

@n *Based _solely on the Examples_ (and the circled-and-labeled variables), students must derive the function definition.*

* If the Examples don't provide enough information, they pass the paper back and the original author has to re-do them.

This activity can be repeated several times, or done as a timed competition between teams. The goal is to emphasize that each step - if done correctly - makes the following step incredibly simple.

=== Synthesize
The Design Recipe is a way of slowing down and thinking through each step of a problem. If we already know how to get the answer, why would it ever be important to know how to do each step the slow way?

_Sample Responses:_

- Someday we won't be able to get the answer, and knowing the steps will help
- So we can help someone else who is stuck
- So we can work with someone else and share our thinking
- So we can check our work

Which step in the Design Recipe are students feeling the most confident about? The least? At this stage, it is normal for students to feel most confident about the Contract and Examples, and the least confident about Purpose Statements and Definitions.

*Optional:* Ask students to create their own appropriately challenging word problem (with a solution) and collect the responses for later use as "Do Now" tasks or formative assessment.
