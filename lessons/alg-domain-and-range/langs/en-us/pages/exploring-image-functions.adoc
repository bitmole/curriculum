By now you know how to make stars in our programming language. Can you figure out how to make triangles, based on what you know about making stars? How about Circles? Squares? What other shapes might we be able to make? 

1) When you've discovered how to make a new shape, draw the Circle of Evaluation in the table below, along with a sketch of the shape.

@vspace{2ex}

Use the space below to draw the Circles of Evaluation for the new functions.
You can also sketch a picture of what the function produces, as shown.

[cols="^.^1,^.^24,^.^8,.^8", options="header", stripes="none"]
|===
|Circle of Evaluation 							|				 | Image
|@show{(sexp->coe '(star 50 "solid" "black"))}	| produces &rarr;|@span{.big}{&#9733;}
|@vspace{10ex}									| produces &rarr;|
|@vspace{10ex}									| produces &rarr;|
|@vspace{10ex}									| produces &rarr;|
|@vspace{10ex}									| produces &rarr;|

2) There is a function called `text`. Try to figure out how to use it! What do the inputs mean?

@span{.blankline}

@span{.blankline}

@span{.blankline}

3) There is a function called `radial-star` with 5 inputs. What do they mean?

@span{.blankline}

@span{.blankline}

@span{.blankline}
