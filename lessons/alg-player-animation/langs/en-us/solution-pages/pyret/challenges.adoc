= Challenges for update-player

For each of the challenges below, see if you can come up with two EXAMPLEs of how it should work!

1) *Warping* - Program one key to "warp" the player to a set location, such as the center of the screen.

```
examples:
  update-player(_128, "t"_) is  @fitb{20ex}{ _375_ }

  update-player(_128  "b"_) is  @fitb{20ex}{ _125_ }
end                        
```

2) *Boundaries* - Change `update-player` such that `PLAYER` cannot move off the top or bottom of the screen.

```
examples:
  update-player(_480 "up"_) is  @fitb{20ex}{ _480_ }

  update-player(_0 "down"_) is  @fitb{20ex}{ _0_ }
end                        
```

3) *Wrapping* - Add code to `update-player` such that when `PLAYER` moves to the top of the screen, it reappears at the bottom, and vice versa.

```
examples:
  update-player(_490 "up"_) is  @fitb{20ex}{ _0_ }

  update-player(_-10 "down"_) is @fitb{20ex}{ _480_ }
end                        
```

4) *Hiding* - Add a key that will make `PLAYER` seem to dis  @fitb{20ex}{appear, and reappear when the same key is  @fitb{20ex}{ pressed again.

```
examples:
  update-player(_128 "h"_) is  	@fitb{20ex}{ _-1 * 128_ }

  update-player(_-391 "h"_) is  @fitb{20ex}{   _-1 * -391_ }
end                        
```
