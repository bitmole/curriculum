= Image Scatterplot - Explore

Before you go back to pyret, let's think about this line of code:

[.center]
`image-scatter-plot(animals-table, "pounds", "weeks", speciestag)`

@n What Datatype is `speciestag`? @fitb{30em}

@n What does `speciestag` do?

@span{.blankline}

@span{.blankline}

@n What do you expect the described `image-scatterplot` to look like?

@span{.blankline}

@span{.blankline}

@n Go back to the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1Yskwvzbe5CSMX3F1fveEOgrL3ms2cxHV&v=1904b2c, Species Starter File} and type the code into the interactions area. Describe the image you see.

@n What can you learn from this new display that you could not learn from the original image?

@span{.blankline}

@n What ideas do you have for how this `image-scatter-plot` could be even more useful?

@n What would be the first step to making a new `image-scatter-plot` that pounds and weeks to adoption, where each point was labeled with the name of the animal instead of its species?

@span{.blankline}

@n Make the new `image-scatter-plot` described above.
