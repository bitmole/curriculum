= Image Scatterplot - Explore

@n Let's think about this line of code: `image-scatter-plot(animals-table, "pounds", "weeks", speciestag)`

What Datatype is `speciestag`? @fitb{30em}

@n What does `speciestag` do when you run the program? (_Hint: look for its definition in the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1Yskwvzbe5CSMX3F1fveEOgrL3ms2cxHV&v=1904b2c, Species Starter File}!_)

@n Before you type the code into the interactions area, think about what you expect the `image-scatterplot` to look like. Then test it out and describe the image you see.

@n What can you learn from this new display that you could not learn from the original image?

@span{.blankline}

@n What ideas do you have for how this display could be even more useful?

@n Find the other two "Helper Methods" in the file. How is the structure of their definitions similar to `species-tag`?

@n How is the structure of their definitions different from `species-tag`?

@n Make an `image-scatterplot` using `legs-tag`. Then make an `image-scatterplot` using `age-tag`. What is most interesting to you about the plots you just made?

@n What would be the first step to making a new `image-scatter-plot` that pounds and weeks to adoption, where each point was labeled with the name of the animal instead of its species?

@n Make the new `image-scatter-plot` described above. Record your new helper function here:
