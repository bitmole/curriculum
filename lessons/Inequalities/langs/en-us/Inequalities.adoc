@lesson-description{Students apply knowledge of inequalities to create compound inequalities}

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Describe the solution set of a compound inequality
* Explain the 'Boolean' datatype

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use two or more inequalities together and describe the area they enclose.
* I can explain to someone else what a Boolean is.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The new Boolean datatype, while simple to explain, can be confusing for some students as parts of a Contract.  Remind students that Boolean is just another datatype, like Number, or Image, but it can only be one of two choices: true or false.   
* Functions that produce Booleans are typically questions, hence the ? part of the function names in this lesson (safe-left?, onscreen?).
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `safe-left?`, `safe-right?`, and `onscreen?`.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

Hand out, or have students open, the @link{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WvlflsKM28IOwgyV2HttnGxul3sAUnL0-KOZhvb6C2s/edit, Inequalities Warmup} and complete with a partner.    

== Explore: (5 min)

Have students open the @link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=48low6MazC&, Sam The Butterfly starter file}, _workbook page_, and investigate the program with their partner.  Let students figure out that they need to press "Run" to see what the program does, and that the arrow keys control Sam. 

== Discuss: (5 min)

* What is something you noticed about this program? _Answers will vary: Sam can me moved with the arrow keys, the coordinates are displayed at the top of the screen, the coordinates are all in the 1st quadrant, etc._
* What do you see when Sam is at (0,0)?  Why is that? _You only see part of Sam's wing.  Sam's position is based on the center of Sam's image._
* How far can Sam go to the left and stay within Mom's view?  _Up to, but not beyond, an x of -40._
* How can we state this boundary mathematically? _x >= -40 or x > -50_
* What will the contract for `safe-left?` look like?  What does it need to take in?  What will it give back?  _`safe-left?` should take in a Number (the x-coordinate) and return a Boolean (true if Sam is safe, false if not)_

== Practice: (10 min)

With their partners, students complete _workbook page_ to fix the `safe-left?` and `safe-right?` functions and type it into their file to test it.  

Students will notice that their `safe-left?` function keeps Sam from disappearing off the left, but `safe-right?` doesn't keep Sam from disappearing off the right side!  When students run into this, encourage them to look through the code to try and figure out why.

== Discuss II: (10 min)

* What does `safe-left?` do?  _Checks to see if x is greater than -50_
* What does `safe-right?` do? _Checks to see if x is less than 490_
* What does `onscreen?` do? _Answers may vary, let students discuss with each other_

Recruit some student volunteers to roleplay the functions `safe-left?`, `safe-right?` and `onscreen?` while giving function calls to `onscreen?`

=== Role Play Example

Facilitator: onscreen-huh 70
Onscreen?: safe-left-huh 70
Safe-left?: true
Onscreen?: true

Facilitator: onscreen-huh -100
Onscreen?: safe-left-huh -100
Safe-left?: false
Onscreen?: false

Facilitator: onscreen-huh 600
Onscreen?: safe-left-huh 600
Safe-left?: true
Onscreen?: true

* What is the problem with `onscreen?`? _It's only talking to `safe-left?`, it's not checking with `safe-right?`_
* How can `onscreen?` check with both?  _By using `and`_

Have students complete _workbook page_ with their partner before moving on.

== Apply: (10 min)

Students use what they've learned to fix the `onscreen?` function and should now see that Sam cannot move off of the left or right sides of the screen.

Extension Option
****
What if we wanted to keep Sam safe on the top and bottom edges of the screen as well?  What additional functions would we need?
