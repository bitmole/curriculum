@lesson-description{Students apply knowledge of inequalities to create compound inequalities.}


[@lesson-intro-table]
|===
@prereqs-stds{FunctionApplications3}
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Describe the solution set of a compound inequality
* Explain the 'Boolean' datatype

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use two or more inequalities together and describe the area they enclose.
* I can explain to someone else what a Boolean is.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The new Boolean datatype, while simple to explain, can be confusing for some students as parts of a Contract.  @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Number, or Image, but it can only be one of two choices: true or false.   
* Functions that produce Booleans are typically questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
For example, `safe-left?`, `onscreen?` are both functions that are asking if a condition, such as an image being on the screen, is true or false.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `safe-left?`, `safe-right?`, and `onscreen?`. 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
For example, `is-safe-left`, `is-onscreen` are both functions that are asking if a condition, such as an image being on the screen, is true or false.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `is-safe-left`, `is-safe-right`, and `is-onscreen`.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

Have students open to the @worksheet-link{pages/Inequalities-WB1.pdf, Inequalities Launch} worksheet and complete with a partner.    

== Explore: (5 min)

Have students open the 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=48low6MazC&, Sam The Butterfly starter file} 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1B5T5dTyRPb3rKJBZOgbYbQcFcsDeYZAA&v=f1d3c87, Sam The Butterfly starter file} 
endif::[]
and click "Save A Copy". +
Have students turn to the @worksheet-link{pages/Inequalities-WB2.pdf, Inequalities Explore worksheet} and investigate the program with their partner. 

_Let students figure out that they need to press "Run" to see what the program does, and that the arrow keys control Sam._ +

== Discuss: (5 min)

* *What is something you noticed about this program?* 
+
_Sam can be moved with the arrow keys, the @vocab{coordinate}s are displayed at the top of the screen, the coordinates are all in the 1st quadrant, etc._
* *What do you see when Sam is at (0,0)?  Why is that?* 
+
_You only see part of Sam's wing.  Sam's position is based on the center of Sam's image._
* *How far can Sam go to the left and stay within Mom's view?*  
+
_Up to, but not beyond, an x of -40._
* *How could we write this as an @vocab{expression}?* 
+
_x >= -40 or x > -50_

=== Every time Sam moves, we want to check and see if Sam is safe.  This is a repetitive job, so it would make an excellent @vocab{function}!  Let's focus on keeping Sam safe on the left side first.
{empty} +
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* *What will the contract for `safe-left?` look like?  What does it need to take in?  What will it give back?*  
+
_``safe-left?`` should take in a Number (the x-coordinate) and return a Boolean (true if Sam is safe, false if not)_
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* *What will the contract for `is-safe-left` look like?  What does it need to take in?  What will it give back?*  
+
_``is-safe-left`` should take in a Number (the x-coordinate) and return a Boolean (true if Sam is safe, false if not)_
endif::[]

== Practice: (10 min)

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
With their partners, students complete @worksheet-link{pages/Inequalities-EX1.adoc, Design Recipe: safe-left?} and @worksheet-link{pages/Inequalities-EX2.adoc, Design Recipe: safe-right?}.  Once finished, students can fix the `safe-left?` and `safe-right?` functions in their Sam the Butterly file and test their functions.

Students will notice that fixing `safe-left?` keeps Sam from disappearing off the left, but fixing `safe-right?` doesn't seem to keep Sam from disappearing off the right side!  When students encounter this, encourage them to look through the code to try and figure out why.

== Discuss II: (10 min)

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* *What does `safe-left?` do?*  
+
_Checks to see if x is greater than -50_
* *What does `safe-right?` do?*
+
_Checks to see if x is less than 490_
* *What does `onscreen?` do?* 
+
_Answers may vary, let students drive the discussion!_

*Recruit some student volunteers to roleplay the functions `safe-left?`, `safe-right?` and `onscreen?` while giving function calls to `onscreen?`.* +

=== Role Play Example

*To visually demonstrate why `onscreen?` isn't preventing Sam from going off the right side, have students act it out!  The student who plays `onscreen?` will only ask the student playing `safe-left?` if Sam is safe, ignoring `safe-right?` at this point.  Have students watching discuss and explain what is happening and brainstorm how to fix `onscreen?`.* +
{empty} +
These cues can be printed on the back of notecards to help student volunteers with their part.
{empty} +
* *Facilitator*: "onscreen-huh 70"
* *onscreen?*: "safe-left-huh 70"
* *safe-left?*: "true"
* *onscreen?*: "true" +
{empty} +

* *Facilitator*: "onscreen-huh -100"
* *onscreen?*: "safe-left-huh -100"
* *safe-left?*: "false"
* *onscreen?*: "false" +
{empty} +

* *Facilitator*: "onscreen-huh 600"
* *onscreen?*: "safe-left-huh 600"
* *safe-left?*: "true"
* *onscreen?*: "true" +
{empty} +

*Ask the rest of the class-* +
* What is the problem with `onscreen?`? 
+
_It's only talking to `safe-left?`, it's not checking with ``safe-right?``_
* How can `onscreen?` check with both?  
+
_It needs to talk to `safe-left?` AND ``safe-right?``_

*Guide students through examples of `and` and `or` with various statements, such as "I'm wearing a red shirt AND I'm a math teacher, true or false?" or "I'm an NBA basketball star OR I'm having pizza for lunch, true or false?".*  

* What is the contract for `and`? 
+
_``and: Boolean Boolean -> Boolean``_
* What functions did we create that return Boolean values? 
+
_``safe-left?`` and ``safe-right?``_

Have students complete @worksheet-link{pages/Inequalities-WB3.pdf, Inequalities Practice} before moving on to the @worksheet-link{pages/Inequalities-EX3.adoc, Design Recipe: onscreen?}.

== Apply: (10 min)

Students use what they've learned to fix the `onscreen?` function and should now see that Sam cannot move off of the left or right sides of the screen.

.Extension Option
****
What if we wanted to keep Sam safe on the top and bottom edges of the screen as well?  What additional functions would we need?  What functions would need to change?
