*Students apply knowledge of inequalities to create compound inequalities*

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Describe the solution set of a compound inequality
* Explain the 'Boolean' datatype

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use two or more inequalities together and describe the area they enclose.
* I can explain to someone else what a Boolean is.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The new Boolean datatype, while simple to explain, can be confusing for some students.  
* Functions that produce Booleans are typically questions, hence the ? part of the function names in this lesson (safe-left?, onscreen?).
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of safe-left?, safe-right?, and onscreen?.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
