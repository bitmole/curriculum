= Inequalities

*Students apply knowledge of inequalities to create compound inequalities*

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Describe the solution set of a compound inequality
* Explain the 'Boolean' datatype

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use two or more inequalities together and describe the area they enclose.
* I can explain to someone else what a Boolean is.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The new Boolean datatype, while simple to explain, can be confusing for some students as parts of a Contract.  Remind students that Boolean is just another datatype, like Number, or Image, but it can only be one of two choices: true or false.   
* Functions that produce Booleans are typically questions, hence the ? part of the function names in this lesson (safe-left?, onscreen?).
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `safe-left?`, `safe-right?`, and `onscreen?`.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

Hand out, or have students open, the @link{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WvlflsKM28IOwgyV2HttnGxul3sAUnL0-KOZhvb6C2s/edit, Inequalities Warmup} and complete with a partner.    

== Explore: (10 min)

Have students open the @link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=48low6MazC&, Sam The Butterfly starter file} and investigate the program with their partner.  Let students figure out that they need to press "Run" to see what the program does, and that the arrow keys control Sam.   

== Discuss: (10 min)

* What is something you noticed about this program? _Answers will vary: Sam can me moved with the arrow keys, the coordinates are displayed at the top of the screen, the coordinates are all in the 1st quadrant, etc._
* What do you see when Sam is at (0,0)?  Why is that? _You only see part of Sam's wing.  Sam's position is based on the center of Sam's image._
* 

== Practice: (10 min)

With their partners, students complete _workbook page_ to fix the `safe-left?` and `safe-right?` functions and type it into their file to test it.  



== Apply: (10 min)
