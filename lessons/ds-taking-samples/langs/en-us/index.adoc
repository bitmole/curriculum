= Taking Samples

@lesson-description{Students learn about grouped and random samples, and practive creating them from the animals dataset. In the process, they practice using the Design Recipe to create filter functions, and come up with questions they wish to explore.}

== Random Samples @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
This activity is all about @vocab{random samples}: how well does a random sample of a population _represent_ the whole population? Students make differently-sized random samples of the animals dataset, and see how well each sample represents the population. They begin to explore the concept of _sample size_.

=== Launch
Suppose we want to survey Americans and try to predict who our next president will be. It would take too long to ask everyone who they’re voting for, so pollsters instead take a _sample_ of Americans, and _generalize_ the opinion of the sample to estimate how Americans as a whole feel. But choosing a sample can be tricky...

[.lesson-instruction]
* Would it be problematic to only call voters who are registered Democrats? To only call voters under 25? To only call regular churchgoers? Why or why not?
* How could we choose a representative subset, or _sample_ of American voters?

Sampling is a complicated issue! Depending on the question we want to answer, we often want carve out a subset of the data (e.g. calling only women, calling a random sample of 2000 people, etc). Sometimes we want to create a @vocab{random sample} of an existing dataset. 

[.lesson-point]
Make subsets first!

Data Scientists don’t always know what the interesting questions are right away. So whenever they explore a dataset, one of the first things do is define different kinds of @vocab{samples}, just to have them handy later. This also helps them reason about the data, without being biased by a particular question.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
--
* Make a pie-chart showing how many of each species is in the shelter, by writing `pie-chart(animals-table, "species")`. 
* Type each of the following lines into the Interactions Area and hit “Enter".
----
random-rows(animals-table, 5)
random-rows(animals-table, 15)
----
* What do you get?
* What is the contract for `random-rows`? What does the function do?
* In the Definitions Area, define `tiny-subset` and `small-subset` to be these two random samples.
* Make the same pie chart, but using each these subsets: `pie-chart(tiny-subset, "species")`.
* Which pie chart is _most representative_ of the whole table? 
* How large does a random sample have to be, to allow us to generalize? 1/10th the size of the dataset? 1/4th?

=== Synthesize
Have students share their results, and discuss how large a sample needs to be for it to be "representative".

If appropriate for your learning goes, this is a great place to include more rigorous statistics content about sample size.

== Grouped Samples @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
This activity is all about @vocab{grouped samples}: Students make a bunch of subsets from the animals dataset, and see how each subset might answer the same question differently.

=== Launch
Cats and Dogs are very different characteristics. Dogs tend to weigh more, and cats tend to live longer. If we're asking questions about weight or lifespan, it might make more sense to ask those questions about "just the cats" or "just the dogs". Averaging every animal together will give us an answer, but it may not be a _useful_ answer. 

Sometimes, important facts about subsets get _lost_ if we mix them with the rest of the population! Imagine that you've been handed a dataset from a country where half the people are wealthy and have access to amazing medical care, and the other half are poor and have no healthcare. Looking at the population as a whole, we might say that they are generally middle-income and have average health. But if we ask the same question about the two groups _separately_, we would discover inequality hiding in plain sight!.

Data Scientists make @vocab{grouped samples} of datasets, breaking them up into sub-groups that may be helpful in their analysis. 

=== Investigate

A “kitten” is an animal whose _is a cat_ and who _is young_. How would you make a subset of just kittens?

* Turn to @workbook-link{pages/samples-from-animals-dataset.adoc}, and see what code will compute whether or not an animal is a kitten. 
* Can you fill in the code for the other subsets? 
* When you're done, type these definitions into the Definitions Area.
--

We already know how to define values, and how to filter a dataset. So let’s put those skills together to define one of our subsets:
----
dogs  = animals-table.filter(is-dog)
----

[.lesson-instruction]
* Define the other subsets, and click "Run". 
* Make a pie chart showing the species in the `young` subset, by typing `pie-chart(young, "species")`.
* Make pie charts for every grouped sample. Which one is the most representative of the whole population? Why?

=== Synthesize
Debrief with students. Thoughtful question: how could we filter _and_ sort a table? How can we combine methods?

== Displaying Data @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students revisit the data display activity, now using the subsets they created.

=== Launch
Making grouped and random samples is a powerful skill to have, which allows us to dig deeper than just making charts or asking questions about a whole dataset. Now that we know how to make subsets, we can make much more sophisticated displays!

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @workbook-link{pages/data-displays2.adoc}, using what you've learned about subsets to make more sophisticated data displays.

=== Synthesize
Were any of the students' displays interesting or surprising? Given a novel question, can students identify what helper functions they would need to write?
