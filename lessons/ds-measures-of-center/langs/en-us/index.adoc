== Introduction  (Time 10 minutes)

[.lesson-instruction]
Open your “Animals Starter File”. (If you do not have this file, or if something has happened to it, you can always make a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1gaYAyYhvlKBm6VJuvJDcnoINBw76pL-L, new copy}.)

In the last Unit, you learned how to talk about shape by looking at histograms. In this Unit, you’ll learn about two more key features of a quantitative data set -- center and @vocab{spread} -- and how to connect those back to a visual representation.

[.lesson-point]
According to the Animal Shelter Bureau, the average pet weighs almost 41 pounds.

[.lesson-instruction]
Some medicines are dosed by weight: larger animals need a larger dose. If someone at the shelter needs to give a dose of medicine to an animal, is 41 pounds the best estimate for how much it weighs?

Invite an open discussion for a few minutes.

“The average pet weighs 41 pounds” is a statement about the entire dataset, which summarizes a whole column of values with a single number. Summarizing a big dataset means that some information gets lost, so it’s important to pick an appropriate summary. Picking the wrong summary can have serious implications! Here are just a few examples of summary data being used for important things. Do you think these summaries are appropriate or not?

- Students are sometimes summarized by two numbers -- their GPA and SAT scores -- which can impact where they go to college or how much financial aid they get.
- Schools are sometimes summarized by a few numbers -- student pass rates and attendance, for example -- which can determine whether or not a school gets shut down.
- Adults are often summarized by a single number -- like their credit score -- which determines their ability to get a job or a home loan.
- When buying uniforms for a sports team, a coach might look for the most-common size that the players wear.

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you think of other examples where a number or two are used to summarize something complex?

Every kind of summary has situations in which it does a good job of reporting what’s typical, and others where it doesn’t really do justice to the data. In fact, the shape of the data can play a huge role in whether or not one kind of summary is appropriate!

Data Scientists summarize quantitative data by reporting two key features: what’s the typical value (center) and how much do the values typically vary (spread). Let’s check the “41 pounds” claim and see if it’s an appropriate measure of center. Later on, you’ll have a chance to apply what you’ve learned to your own dataset, to find the best way to provide an overall summary of the data.

== Measures of Center  (Time 20 minutes)

If we plotted all the pounds values as points on a number line, what could we say about the average of those values? Is there a midpoint? Is there a point that shows up most often? Each of these are different ways of “measuring center”.

////
Draw some sample points on a number line, and have students volunteer different ways to summarize the distribution.
////

The Animal Shelter Bureau used one method of summary, called the @vocab{mean}, or average. In general, the mean of a data set is the sum of values divided by the number of values. To take the average of a column, we add all the numbers in that column and divide by the number of rows.

////
This lesson does not teach the algorithm for computing averages, but this would be an appropriate time to do so.
////

Pyret has a way for us to compute the mean of any column in a Table. It consumes a Table and the name of the column you want to measure, and produces the mean -- or average -- of the numbers in that column.

----
# mean :: (t :: Table, col :: String) -> Number
----

[.lesson-instruction]
What is its name? Domain? Range?

Notice that calculating the mean requires being able to add and divide, so the mean only makes sense for quantitative data. For example, the mean of a list of Presidents doesn’t make sense. Same thing for a list of zip codes: even though we can divide a sum of zip codes, the output doesn’t correspond to some “center” zip code.

Type `mean(animals-table, "pounds")`. What does this give us?
Does this support the Bureau’s claims?

[.lesson-instruction]
Open your workbooks to Page 30. We’ve already decided on the answer to Question 1 (`pounds`). Under the “measures of center” section, fill in the computed mean.

You computed the mean of that column to be almost exactly 41 pounds. That IS the average, but if we look at the dots on our number line, we can see most of the animals weigh less than 41 pounds! that more than half of the animals weigh less than just 15 pounds. What is throwing off the average so much?

////
Point students to Kujo and Mr. Peanutbutter.

In this case, the mean is being thrown off by a few extreme data points. These extreme points are called @vocab{outliers}, because they fall far outside of the rest of the dataset. Calculating the mean is great when all the points are fairly balanced on either side of the middle, but it breaks down for datasets with extreme outliers. The mean may also be thrown off by the presence of @vocab{skew}: a lopsided shape due to values trailing off left or right of center, but not separated by the visible gap typical of outliers.

[.lesson-instruction]
Make a `histogram` of the `pounds` column, and try different bin sizes. Can you see the skew towards the right, with a huge number of animals clumped to the left?

A different way to measure center is to line up all of the data points -- in order -- and find a point in the center where half of the values are smaller and the other half are larger. This is the @vocab{median}, or “middle” value of a list.

As an example, consider this list:

  2, 3, 1

Here 2 is the median, because it separates the “top half” (all values greater than 2, which is just 3), and the “bottom half” (all values less than or equal to 2).

////
We recommend the following “pencil and paper algorithm” for median finding:

Sort the list.
Cross out the highest number.
Cross out the lowest number.
Repeat until there is only one number left -- the median. If there
are two numbers, take the mean of those numbers.
////

Pyret has a function to compute the median of a list as well, with the contract:

----
# median :: (t :: Table, col :: String) -> Number
----

[.lesson-instruction]
Compute the median for the pounds column in our dataset, and add this to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}. Is it different than the mean? What can we conclude when the median is so much lower than the mean? For practice, compute the mean and median for the weeks and age columns.

The third and last measure of center is the @vocab{mode} of a dataset. The @vocab{mode} of a data set is the value that appears _most often_. Median and Mean always produce one number, but if two or more values are equally common, there can be more than one mode. If all values are equally common, then there is no mode at all! Often there will be just one number in the list: many data sets are what we call “unimodal”. But sometimes there are exceptions! Consider the following three datasets:

  1, 2, 3, 4
  1, 2, 2, 3, 4
  1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4

- The first dataset has _no mode at all!_
- The mode of the second data set is 2, since 2 appears more than any other number.
- The mode of the last data set is both 1 and 4, because 1 and 4 both appear more often than any other element, and because they appear equally often.

In Pyret, the modes are calculated by the modes function, which consumes a Table and the name of the column you want to measure, and produces a List of Numbers.

----
# modes :: (t :: Table, col :: String) -> List<Number>
----

[.lesson-instruction]
Compute the `modes` of the `pounds` column, and add it to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/summarizing-columns-in-animals.adoc}. What did you get? The most common number of pounds an animal weighs is 6.5! That’s well below our mean and even our median, which is further evidence of outliers or skewness.

At this point, we have a lot of evidence that suggests the Bureau’s use of “mean” to summarize data isn’t ideal. Our mean weight agrees with their findings, but we have three reasons to suspect that @vocab{mean} isn’t the best value to use:

- The median is only 13.4 pounds.
- The mode of our dataset is only 6.5 pounds, which suggests a cluster of animals that weigh less than one-sixth the mean.
- When viewed as a histogram, we can see the rightward skew in the dataset. Mean is sensitive to highly-skewed datasets

The Animal Shelter Bureau started with a fact: the mean weight _is_ about 41 pounds. But then they reported a conclusion without checking to see if that was the best summary statistic to look at. As Data Scientists, we had to look deeper into the data to find out whether or not to settle for the Bureau’s summary. This is why using tools like histograms can be so important when deciding on a summary tool.

[.lesson-instruction]
“In 2003, the average American family earned $43,000 a year -- well above the poverty line! Therefore very few Americans were living in poverty." Do you trust this statement? Why or why not?

Consider how many policies or laws are informed by statistics like this! Knowing about measures of center helps us see through misleading statements.

[.lesson-instruction]
Shape Matters

You now have three different ways to measure center in a dataset. But how do you know which one to use? Depending on the shape of the dataset, a measure could be really useful or totally misleading! Here are some guidelines for when to use one measurement over the other:
- If the data is doesn’t show much skewness or have outliers, @vocab{mean} is the best summary because it incorporates information from every value.
- If the data clearly has a lot of outliers or skewness, @vocab{median} gives a better summary of center than the mean.
- If there are very few possible values, such as AP Scores (1–5), the @vocab{mode} could be a useful way to summarize the data set.


== Closing (Time 5 minutes)

Data Scientists are skeptical people: they don’t trust a claim unless they can see the data, or at least get some summary information about the center and shape of the dataset. In the next Unit, you’ll investigate new ways to visualize spread and distribution.
