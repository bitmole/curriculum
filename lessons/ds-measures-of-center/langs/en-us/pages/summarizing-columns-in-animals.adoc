= Summarizing Columns in the Animals Dataset

1) The column I chose to summarize is @fitb{20ex}{pounds}.

@vspace{1ex}

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Median | Q3 | Maximum

| @span{.vskip}{} ||||
|===

== Measures of Center

The three measures of center for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

| @span{.vskip}{} ||
|===

2) Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[higher/lower/about equal]} compared to the median, this suggests this suggests the shape is @fitbruby{60ex}{}{[skewed right (or high outliers) / skewed left (or low outliers) / symmetric]}.

== Displaying Center and Spread with a Box Plot

A box plot can be drawn from this summary on the number line below:

From this summary and box-plot, I conclude:

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}
