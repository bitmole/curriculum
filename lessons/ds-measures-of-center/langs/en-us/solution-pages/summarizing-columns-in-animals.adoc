= Summarizing Columns in the Animals Dataset

1) The column I chose to measure is
@fitb{20ex}{pounds}.
@vspace{1ex}

== Measures of Center

The three measures for this column are:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Mean (Average)| Median | Mode(s)

| ~40.9 		| 13.4 	 | 6.5
|===

2) Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{higher}{[higher/lower]} than the median, this suggests that there may be outliers or skewness due to values that are unusually @fitbruby{20ex}{low}{[high/low]}.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols="^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a,^1a",options="header"]
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Q2 (Median) | Q3 | Maximum

| 0.1	  | 4.3| 13.4		 | 68 | 172
|===
