= Measures of Center

// use double-space before the *bold* text to address a text-kerning bug in wkhtmltopdf 0.12.5 (with patched qt)
- There are three ways to measure the “center” of a dataset, to summarize a whole column of data using just one number:

** The *mean* of a dataset is the average of all the numbers.

** The *median* of a dataset is a value that is smaller than half the dataset, and larger than the other half.

** The *mode(s)* of a dataset is the value (or values) that occurs most often.

	- In a  *symmetric* data set, values are just as likely to occur a certain distance above or below the mean, and the median and mean are usually close together. 

	- A data set with *left skew*, and/or low outliers, has a few values that are unusually low, pulling the mean _below_ the median.

	- A data set with *right skew*, and/or high outliers, means there are a few values that are unusually high, pulling the mean _above_ the median.
