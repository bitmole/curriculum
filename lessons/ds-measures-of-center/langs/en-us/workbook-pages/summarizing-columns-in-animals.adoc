= Summarizing Columns in `Animals`

1) The column I choose to measure is
@fitb{20ex}{pounds}.
@vspace{1ex}
== Measures of Center

The three measures for this column are:

[cols='3',options='header']
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

| @span{.vskip}{} ||
|===

2) Since the mean is @fitbruby{20ex}{}{[higher/lower]} than the median, this suggests that there may
be outliers or skewness due to values that are unusually
@fitbruby{20ex}{}{[high/low]}.

== Measures of Spread

My five-number summary is:

[cols='5',options='header']
|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Q2 (Median) | Q3 | Maximum

| @span{.vskip}{} ||||
|===

A box plot can be drawn from this summary on the number line below:

From this summary and box-plot, I conclude:

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}

@span{.blankline}{}
