= Measures of Center

- There are three ways to measure the “center” of a dataset, to summarize a
whole column of data using just one number:

** The *mean* of a dataset is the average of all the numbers.

** The *median* of a dataset is a value that is smaller than half the dataset, and
larger than the other half.

** The *mode(s)* of a dataset is the value (or values) that occurs most often.

- The *shape* of a data set tells us which values are more or less common. In a
_symmetric_ data set, values are just as likely to occur a certain distance above or
below the mean. A data set with left skewness and/or low outliers has a few
values that are unusually low, pulling the mean below the median. Right
skewness and/or high outliers means there are a few values that are unusually
high, pulling the mean above the median.
