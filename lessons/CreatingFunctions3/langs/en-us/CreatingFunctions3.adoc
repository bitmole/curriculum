MLR 6: 3 Reads 
In pairs, the word problem is read 3 times. Students will document their work in the "3 Reads/Stronger & Clearer" handout.

* 1st Read: Teacher reads the word problem. Without any pencil or pen, students discuss: What is the problem about? 
* 2nd Read: Partner A reads. Students discuss: What are the quantities?
* 3rd Read: Partner B reads. What is a good purpose statement?

MLR 1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time 
Using the "3 Reads/Stronger & Clearer" handout, students will switch partners 3 times.

* 1st new partner: Read their purpose statements to each other & revise the purpose statement to be stronger and clearer.
* 2nd new partner: Repeat.
* 3rd new partner: Repeat.
****

Write 2 EXAMPLES & The Definition

* Given The Contract and Purpose statement, write 2 examples of `rocket-height`
* Circle and Label what's changing in the 2 examples. What's a good variable name for what's changing?
* Write the `define` line of code that uses the decided upon variable name.
* Once the enter Design Recipe has been completed in the workbook, and the teacher has checked it for accuracy, then allow the students to type the code into the program to fix the `rocket-height` function.
