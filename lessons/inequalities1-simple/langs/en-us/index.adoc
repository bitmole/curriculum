| Key Points for the Facilitator
|* A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Numbers or Images.  But unlike those types, there are only _two_ values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
* Boolean-producing functions are essentially yes-or-no questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
* For example, `odd?` and `even?` (pronounced "odd-huh?" and "even-huh?" in Scheme) are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `odd?` and `even?`.
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
* For example, `is-odd`, `is-even` are both functions that ask if a given number is odd or even.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `is-odd` and `is-even`.

== Introducing Inequalities @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover (or expand their understanding of) inequalities by identifying solutions and non-solutions and connecting expressions to graphic representations.

=== Launch

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
Have students open the @online-exercise{https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=eVMjb9omtP, Simple Inequalities Starter File.}
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{

Unlike equations, which have finite solution sets, inequalities can have infinite solutions.  Inequality expressions divide all of the numbers in the universe into two categories: solutions and non-solutions.  It is important that students are able to recognize that there are many possible solutions and non-solutions to an inequality and that they can identify whether or not a given number is or isn't part of the solution set.

This starter file includes a special `inequality` function that takes in a function, __which tests numbers in an inequality__, a list of 8 numbers __(to test in the function)__, and plots the numbers and a graph of the inequality on a number line.

When students successfully include 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions, the image returned will show 4 green dots and 4 red dots.

@span{.center}{@image{images/inequality-works.png,"" ,""}}

If their list of 8 values doesn't include an equal number of solutions and non-solutions there will be an unequal distribution of red and green dots and they will get an error message encouraging them to adjust their list.

@span{.center}{@image{images/not-quite.png,"" ,""}}

Encourage students to use negatives, positives, fractions and decimals as they generate their lists.

In order to stop seeing the examples written into the starter file code, students can comment out the example code by adding a # in front of each of the lines they want to hide.
