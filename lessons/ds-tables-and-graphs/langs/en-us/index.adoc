| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* match graphs to tables that represent the same data
* identify linear and non-linear graphs and tables

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* I can match graphs to tables, if they display the same data
* I can tell the difference between linear and non-linear relationships in tables and graphs

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet
* link:{pathwayrootdir}/workbook/workbook.pdf[Student workbook], and something to write with
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Graphing Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=XYZ, open a new one}

| Key Points for the Facilitator
| This lesson is about two big ideas:

* Linear relationships, as defined by slope and y-intercept
* Matching representations of Tables and Graphs

== Connecting Tables with Graphs @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students consider graphs as an alternate representation of tables.

=== Launch
Take a look at the following Table and Graph:

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
|

[.pyret-table.first-table,cols="1,1",options="header"]
!===
! x ! y
! 0 ! 0
! 1 ! 2
! 2 ! 4
! 3 ! 6
! 4 ! 8
!===
| @image{images/2x.png}

|===
[.lesson-instruction]
* What do you *Notice*?
* What do you *Wonder*?

There's a definite connection between the graph and the table. Each x/y-point on the graph represents a row in the Table.

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you predict the next two rows in the table? Could you extend the line on the graph? __How did you arrive at your prediction?__

*Some* tables represent a pattern, and this pattern can be graphed on a coordinate plane.

=== Investigate
All graphs are made of points, each of which has an x- and a y-coordinate. For any graph, we can list ten x's and their matching y's as ten rows in a table.

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note}

To encourage students to look at the _points_ in the table and graph, it is useful to change the scale of the graphs so that all lines look the same. This prevents students from leaning on visual cues like "steepness" to bypass the learning objective.

It can also be useful to list the points in the table __out of order__, both to focus students' attention on the points and to drive home that rows do not have to be ordered!
|===

[.lesson-point]
Axes on a graph have an order. Rows in a tables don't!

The rows in a table are _discrete_, meaning they preserve their meaning if the rows are shuffled into a different order. On a graph, however, the points on a line are _not_ discrete, and cannot be shuffled. 

Lines have properties that depend on that order, like @vocab{slope}. Graphs can be stretched or squished by changing the scale of the axis. This can make the lines _look_ different, but the points will always be in the same order.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Can you match tables and graphs, even if the rows are shuffled and the axes are changed? Complete @exercise-link{pages/match-tables-graphs2.adoc}.

=== Synthesize
Tables, by definition, do not go on forever. That means that a table will only show us _some points_ on a line, whereas a line itself is made up of an _infinite_ number of points. When a table represents a _sample_ of some larger trend, the graph is a way of seeing the trend itself.

== Linear vs. Non-linear

=== Overview
Students explore the concept of linearity, identifying properties like @vocab{slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} (or @vocab{rate} and "starting value") in both tables and graphs.

=== Launch
There is a pattern to each of the numbers below. Can you figure out what the next number should be?

* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
* 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
* 8, 5, 2, -1, -4

Each of these patterns has two properties. They all have a __starting value__ (1, 12, and 8), and they all increase at a consistent @vocab{rate}, growing by the same amount (growing by 1, by 2, and by -3).

Rows in a table don't have to be ordered! In a table that represents a pattern, you may have to _sort_ the rows in order to see the pattern emerge. 

These properties also show up if we view that pattern as a line on a graph. When graphed, the rate is called the @vocab{slope} of the line. Remember that points in a table are discrete, but a line goes forever in both directions. That means there is no "starting value"! Instead, mathematicians use the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which they call the @vocab{y-intercept}.

== Investigate
Can you identify these two properties in a table? In a graph?

- Complete @exercise-link{rates-and-starting-values-tables.adoc}
- Complete @exercise-link{rates-and-starting-values-graphs.adoc}

Patterns that have a slope are called @vocab{linear} patterns, or linear relationships. 

[.lesson-point]
The graph of a linear relationship will always appear as a straight line.

There are other kinds of patterns, which don't have a rate/slope. Can you figure out the next number in the patterns below?

* 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
* 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25
* -10, -6, -1, 6, 15

These patterns are @vocab{nonlinear} patterns. When graphed, they don't look like straight lines at all!

And of course, sometimes there _is_ no pattern. Sometimes the numbers are truly random! A graph can only have one y-value for each x-value, so a table with repeated x-values but different y-values can't be part of a pattern.
