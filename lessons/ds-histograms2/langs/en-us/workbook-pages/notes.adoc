= Visualizing the “Shape” of Data

The *shape* of a data set tells us which values are more or less common. 

	- In a  *symmetric* data set, values are just as likely to occur a certain distance above or below the mean. 

	- A data set that is *skew left* and/or has low outliers has a few values that are unusually low. The histogram for a skew left dataset has a few data points that are stretched out to the left (lower) end of the x-axis.

	- A data set that is *skew right* and/or high outliers means there are a few values that are unusually high. The histogram for a skew left dataset has a few data points that are stretched out to the right (higher) end of the x-axis.
