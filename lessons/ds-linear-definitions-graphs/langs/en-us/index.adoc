| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* use function definitions (function notation and Pyret) to describe linear relationships shown on a graph

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* Given the symbolic form of a function, I can draw the graph
* I can tell the difference between linear and non-linear functions

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet
* link:{pathwayrootdir}/workbook/workbook.pdf[Student workbook], and something to write with
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Graphing Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can @online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=XYZ, open a new one} 

| Key Points for the Facilitator
| Stress that Graphs, Definitions, and Tables are all __different ways of viewing the same function__. The misconception to fight against is the idea that @math{f(x) = 3x + 2} is somehow the "real" function, with the graph being "the thing the function draws."

== From Definitions to Graphs @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students connect graph and notational representations of functions.

=== Launch
Take a look at the following linear function, shown as a definition on the left (shown as Pyret code and regular algebra) and a graph on the right:

[.top-table, cols="^.^1a,^.^1a", frame="none"]
|===
| `fun f(x): 2 * x end`

@math{f(x) = 2x}

* What do you *Notice*?
* What do you *Wonder*?

If we apply this linear function to any point on the x-axis, it produces the y-value that falls on the line. Instead of drawing endless points repeating the same pattern, we can just declare the pattern itself using a __function definition__.

Let's review know how to find the @vocab{slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} in a definition.

@image{images/slope-and-y.png}
One of these terms has an @math{x} in it, and determines the @vocab{slope}. The other term is a number by itself, which is the @vocab{y-intercept}. Note: If there is no number by itself, the y-intercept is "invisible" and can be written out as _zero_.

But how do we find the @vocab{slope} and @vocab{y-intercept} of a graph?

[.lesson-point]
SLOPE: take any two points on the graph, and divide the change in y ("rise") by the change in x ("run").

Let's take the points @math{3, 6} and @math{9, 18}. Dividing the "rise" by the "run", we get @math{\frac{18 - 6}{9 - 3}}, which simplifies to @math{\frac{12}{6}} for a @vocab{slope} of 2. __This is the same strategy we used with Tables!__

[.lesson-point]
Y-INTERCEPT: find where the line crosses the y-axis, at @math{x = 0}

=== Investigate

There are two strategies we could take to see if the notation and graph match:

. Use the function definition to _compute_ some (x, y) pairs, and see if those fall on the graph.
. Find the _slope_ and _y-intercept_ of the function and graph, and see if they are the same.

=== Common Misconceptions
It is incredibly common to think of the graph as the "output" of the function, rather than the function itself. Most math textbooks will use language like "matching the graph to the function", suggesting that the graph is somehow not the function! Since this language is pervasive, it's important to actively push against it.

=== Synthesize
For graphs that fit a pattern like this, a definition can be a much shorter way of describing all of the points on the graph! In fact, a single line of symbols can summarize an _infinite_ number of points.


== Not Every Relationship is Linear! @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _build_ graphs with function definitions, and that not all graphs can be generated from linear functions.

=== Launch
We've provided a special function `make-graph` that takes in a starting point, an ending point, the size of the steps between them, and a function. It produces a __graph__ with those steps as x-coordinates and the output of the function as the y-coordinates. For example:

```
fun f(x): 0.5 * x end
# make a table with xs going from 0-10 in steps of 2
make-graph(0, 10, 2, f)
```

will produce:

@image{images/0.5x.png}

[.lesson-instruction]
* How could we change this code to make a graph for *all* the points between 0 and 10, instead of skipping by 2? 
* How could we change this code to make a graph for all the points between 20 and 200, skipping by 10? 
* How could we change this code to make a graph for a different function altogether? 
* Open the Table and Graphs Starter File, and try defining different functions and using them to build Tables.

=== Investigate
__Non-linear functions__ have terms that involve more than just @math{x}. They might have exotic terms like @math{x^2}, @math{\sqrt x}, @math{2^x} etc. These functions (e.g. - _quadratic_ or _exponential_ functions) have patterns of their own, and very differently-shaped graphs! 

[.lesson-instruction]
* Complete @opt-printable-exercise{define-functions-graphs.adoc}.
* What are some graphs that can't be made from linear functions?

_Any_ graph constructed from a linear function will have points that precisely follow a straight-line pattern. But not every graph follows a pattern like that! Can you tell which is which?

[.lesson-instruction]
Open @opt-printable-exercise{linear-nonlinear-bust.adoc}. Which of these tables can be summarized by a linear function? Which ones can't?

=== Synthesize
@vocab{Functions} are a way of talking about relationships between quantities: milk costs $0.59/gallon, a stone falls at @math{9.8m/s^2}, or there are 30 students for every teacher at a school. If you can figure out the relationship between a small sample of data, we can __make predictions__ about what happens next. We can see these relationships as tables, graphs, or symbols in a definition. We can even think about them as a mapping between @vocab{Domain} and @vocab{Range}! 

When we talk about functions, sometimes it's easiest to think of the graph. Sometimes it's best to see the table, or the definition. *It all depends on what we want to know.* We've just explored @vocab{linear} functions for now, but there are many other kinds of relationships! What's important is being able to switch between representations, and see the connections between them.
