== Your Dataset (Time 40 minutes)

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn back to @worksheet-link{ds-visualizing-relationships/workbook-pages/correlations-in-my-dataset.adoc}, where you listed possible correlations. Use Table Plans and the Design Recipe to investigate these correlations. If you need blank Table Plans or Design Recipes, you can find them at the back your workbook, just before the Contracts.

[.lesson-instruction]
What correlations did you find? Did you need to filter out certain rows in order to get those correlations? Write up your findings by filling out @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/regression-analysis-in-my-dataset.adoc}.

////
Have several students read their findings aloud.

You’ve learned how linear regression can be used to fit a line to a linear cloud, and how to determine the direction and strength of that relationship. The word “linear” is important here. In the image on the right, there’s clearly a pattern, but it doesn’t look like a straight line! There are many other kinds of statistical models out there, but all of them work the same way: use a particular kind of mathematical function (linear or otherwise), to figure out how to get the “best fit” for a cloud of data.
