# Who writes the Code?

We're going to watch this @online-exercise{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc, 5-minute clip} and take a few minutes to write down our notices and wonders @printable-exercise{NoticeAndWonder.adoc, here}.

<!--
Pedagogy Note: Notice and Wonder!

This pedagogy has a @link{https://www.learning-space.org/Page/96, rich grounding in literature}, and is used throughout this course. In the "Notice" phase, students are asked to crowd-source their observations. No observation is too small or too silly! By listening to other students' observations, students may find themselves taking a closer look. The "Wonder" phase involves students raising questions, but they must also explain the context for those questions. Sharon Hessney (moderator for the NYTimes excellent @link{https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph, What's going on in this Graph?} activity) sometimes calls this "what do you wonder...and *why*?". Both of these phases should be done in groups or as a whole class, with adequate time given to each.

# Who writes the Code?

We're going to take a gallery walk of some pioneers in computing and math.

<!--To do a gallery walk, you will need to print and hang posters of @link{pages/computing-pioneers.html, Pioneers in Computing and Mathematics}. If you aren't doing a gallery walk, decide on another format for engaging students with these pioneers.
