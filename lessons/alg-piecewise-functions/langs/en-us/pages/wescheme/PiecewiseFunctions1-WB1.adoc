= Welcome to Luigi's Pizza!

Luigi has hired you to improve some code used at pizza place.
The code we need to work on is shown below.

*Read through the code line-by-line with your partner before writing down your
observations in the tables below.*

----
; cost : String -> Number
; given a Topping, produce the cost of a pizza with that topping
(define (cost topping)
  (cond
    [(string=? topping "cheese")     9.00]
    [(string=? topping "pepperoni") 10.50]
    [(string=? topping "chicken")   11.25]
    [(string=? topping "broccoli")  10.25]
    [else "Sorry, that's not on the menu!"]))
