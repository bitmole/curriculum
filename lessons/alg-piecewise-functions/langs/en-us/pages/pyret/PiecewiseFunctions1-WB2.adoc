= Alice's Restaurant -- Practice

Alice's code has some new elements we haven't seen before, so let's
experiment a bit to figure out how it works! *Open the “Alice's Restaurant” starter
file, click “Run”, and try using the `cost` function in the
Interactions window.*

@vspace{2ex}

1. What does `cost("hamburger")` evaluate to? @fitb{20ex}{}

2. What does ​cost("pie")​ evaluate to? @fitb{20ex}{}


3. What if you ask for ​cost("fries")​? @fitb{20ex}{}

4. Explain what the function is doing in your own words.
@fitb{50ex}{}


5. What is the function's name? @fitb{10ex}{} Domain?
@fitb{10ex}{} Range? @fitb{10ex}{}

6. What is the name of its variable? @fitb{20ex}{}

7. Alice says onion rings have gone up to $3.75. Change the `cost` function to reflect this.

8. Try adding food items of your own. What's your favorite?

9. For an unknown food item, the function produces a String
(`"That's not on the menu!"`)
+
Is this a problem? Why or why not?

10. Suppose Alice wants to calculate the price of the item including a 5% sales tax.
Draw a Circle of Evaluation for the expression below.
