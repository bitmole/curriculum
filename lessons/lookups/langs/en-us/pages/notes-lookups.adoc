= Defining Values, Looking up Rows and Columns

We can define names for values in Pyret, the same way we do in math:

```
name = "Flannery"
age = 16
logo = star(50, "solid", "red")
```

When *looking up a data Row* from a Table, programmers use the `row-n` method. This method takes a single number as its input, which tells the computer which Row we want. _Note: Rows are numbered starting at zero!_

For example:
```
sasha   = animals-table.row-n(0)  # define sasha to be the first row
mittens = animals-table.row-n(2)  # define mittens to be the third row
```

When *looking up a column* from a Row, programmers use square brackets and the name of the column they want.

For example:
```
animals-table.row-n(0)["age"]  # look up the age in the 1st row
mittens["species"]             # look up the species in the third row
```

Throughout the rest of the workbook, we will sometimes refer to animalA and animalB as rows from the table.
```
animalA = animals-table.row-n(4)
animalB = animals-table.row-n(13)
```
