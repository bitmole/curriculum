This lesson introduces students to Contracts, a way of conceptualizing the way functions require certain inputs (domain) in order to produce certain outputs (range).  Through exploring different types of functions, students experience what happens when a contract is not followed and use error messages to identify contract mistakes.  They then record the contracts they’ve learned to keep as a reference for future use. 

== Warm Up: 10 minutes
=== What's Different?

==== Narrative

The purpose of this activity is to give students a brief review of Circles of Evaluation before introducing a new kind of function and function syntax.  The class will make observations about this new function and what it might evaluate to.  The class will discuss how this new type of function will be translated into Pyret syntax and students will have the opportunity to explore and discover new functions. 

==== Launch

Display the following images, giving students adequate time between each one to think about what it will evaluate to. +
{empty} +

@image{images/CoE1.png, Circle of Evaluation, 600, align="center"}

@image{images/CoE2.png, Circle of Evaluation, 600, align="center"}

@image{images/CoE3.png, Circle of Evaluation, 600, align="center"}

@image{images/CoE4.png, Circle of Evaluation, 600, align="center"}

==== Student Task

Take 1-2 minutes for each example to think about what it will evaluate to.  Be ready to explain your thinking to someone else.


==== Synthesis (5 minutes)

Ask students to pair and share their thinking for 5 minutes and try to reach a consensus for all four examples.  Gather student responses for discussion. + 
{empty} +
To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:

* *“Who else noticed this?”*
* *“Did anyone have a different way of explaining this?”*
* *“What other differences did you see in the last example?”*
* *“What information did you use to come to that conclusion?”*
* *“I noticed that you and your partner talked about _______. Can you tell us about that?”*
* *“How does this relate to what we did in Pyret previously?”*
* *“How do you think this Circle of Evaluation translates into code?”*

Students may be tempted to open their computers and try to enter this new code.  However, this function called *star* follows some different rules than the [underline]#operators# `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. + 
{empty} +
Students should have noticed the presence of `"solid"` and `"red"` in the example.  Everything they’ve seen so far has been a *Number* datatype, but these are clearly not numbers.  They are called *Strings*.


== Activity 1: 10 Minutes
=== Learning the Lingo

==== Narrative

The purpose of this activity is for students to learn how functions translate into Pyret syntax and discover new functions with their partner.  Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) follow slightly different rules when translating the Circle of Evaluation into Pyret code.  Operators go *between* the inputs inside the parentheses, just like students are already used to.  Functions go *outside the parentheses*, just like they do with mathematical function notation. +
{empty} +
After learning the syntax and encountering the new *String* data type, students record what they’ve learned on their *Contracts page*.  Explain the meaning of *contract* and that we use contracts in programming to help us use functions correctly.  A function must receive exactly what is it its domain in order to perform its task correctly.  If we don’t give a function what it needs, it won’t give us what we want. +
{empty} +
*To help students make the connection, use language prompts such as “takes in” or “consumes” for input, and “gives back” or “produces” for output.* +
{empty} +
*For example:* +
The contract for `star` is +
`star :: Number, String, String -> Image` +
{empty} +
Use language such as: “The function called "star" takes in a Number and two Strings and produces an Image.” +
{empty} +
The Number tells us the radius from center to point. The first String must be `“solid”` or `“outline”` and the second String must be a color.  The result is an Image of a star of the given specifications.  

==== Launch

Show students the following two images together and give them 2 minutes to Notice and Wonder.

@image{images/CoE5.png, Circle of Evaluation, 600, align="center"}

@image{images/CoE6.png, Circle of Evaluation, 600, align="center"}

After they’ve taken the time to Notice and Wonder, display the contract for `+`.  Ask students what `+` [underline]#needs# in order to function properly.  What does `+` [underline]#take in#?  What does `+` [underline]#produce#?

`+ ``::`` Number, Number -> Number`

==== Student Task 

Look at the two Circles of Evaluation your teacher has displayed. 

. Take 1 minute to *Notice* on your own.
. Take 1 minute to *Wonder* on your own.
. Discuss your thoughts with your partner.
. Look at your *Contracts* page.  What do you think goes in the different columns? 

Look at the contract for `+`. 

What is the _name_?  What is the _domain_?  What is the _range_?

`+ ``::`` Number, Number -> Number`

What do you think *`star`* [underline]#needs# in order to work properly?

==== Student Response

*Anticipated Misconceptions*

Students might be confused about the difference in syntax between operators and functions.  Operators are somewhat special and are usually not considered functions by mathematicians, so it makes sense to keep using them in the way students are used to. +   
{empty} +
Students might not yet know the terms “Domain” and “Range”.  Students may choose to write “Inputs” and “Output” above these columns to help them remember.

==== Synthesis

Ask students how they can remember the difference between Circles of Evaluation that contain operators vs. those that contain functions. 

On their contracts page, they can practice filling out the Contracts for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, as well as `star`.

* “What data type or types do you need to do subtraction?”
* “Does anyone have an observation about these contracts?”
* “What data type or types do you need to make a star?”
* “Is “42” a Number or a String?  How do you know?”

End with a memory hook on the word “contract”.  A *contract* is an agreement, and for programming, it’s an agreement that to use the *`star`* function, the user must provide a Number and two Strings, and the Number and Strings must follow certain rules as well.

== Activity 2: 15 minutes
=== Function Explorers

==== Narrative

The purpose of this activity is for students to explore in their programming environment and discover more functions.  Students should practice good pair programming and make sure to switch roles during the activity.  When error messages appear, students should read them and attempt to figure out what the computer is trying to tell them.  The teacher should be walking the room, noting what functions students are discovering and giving encouragement.  Encourage students to figure out coding errors on their own and to talk to their partners. 

==== Launch 

Have students log on to code.pyret.org and share @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1nLGmhuuUPY6XSoTQ36YJ0Ls9H1OvtsbI&v=09b2597, this link} with them.  
(Alternate: bit.ly/FunctionExplorers) 

==== Student Task

How many functions can you and your partner discover? +
{empty} +
*Press “Run” to get everything ready to go.* +
{empty} +
Use the Interactions (right-side) window to type out this code, then press “Enter”. +
{empty} +
`star(50, “solid”, “red”)` +
{empty} +
Try changing one of the elements of the domain.  What do these elements tell the computer? +
{empty} +
Take turns with your partner exploring and trying to discover new functions.  When you find one, have the Navigator record it on the *Contracts* page. 

==== Synthesis

Ask students to call out functions they discovered while you record them on the board. +
{empty} +
Discuss what this was like, using the following prompts:

* *“How did you feel when you saw an error message appear?”*
* *“How did you feel when you figured out what an error message was trying to tell you?”*
* *“I saw you and your partner trying to get a certain function to work. Can you tell us about it?”*
* *“Did anyone discover any interesting colors?”*
* *“Did anyone discover an option other than “solid”?* 
* *“What data type did you receive as output for the shape functions?”*
* *“What do you think the purpose of the Contracts page is?”*

The shape functions output *Images*, the second new datatype in this lesson.

== Summary
In this lesson, students encountered two new data types, Strings and Images.  They learned how to record a function’s name, domain, and range into their Contracts page to help them remember and stay organized as they learn more functions.

== Cool Down: 5 minutes
=== Wild Stars

==== Narrative

This short activity is a challenge for students to figure out the domain and range of a new function.  More importantly, students should try to figure out what the different elements of the domain stand for. 

`radial-star ``::`` Number, Number, Number, String, String -> Image`

The first Number tells us the number of points, while the second two Numbers tell us the inner and outer radii.  The bigger the difference between these two numbers, the “pointier” the star will appear.  The two Strings tell us the style (“solid” or “outline”) and the color.
Once students have figured it out, have them record the new function on their Contracts page.

==== Launch

==== Student-Facing Task Statement

There is a function called `radial-star`. With your partner, try and figure out how it works!  
. Figure out how many elements are in the domain of radial-star.
. Figure out what the first input to the function does.
. Figure out what the next inputs to the function do.
. Once you think you’ve got it, call your teacher over to explain your thinking.

==== Student Response

Students might struggle to figure out what the second two Numbers stand for.  Suggest that they leave one the same value and just change the other, noting the differences they see.  Ask them what happens when those two values are very close together or very far apart to jumpstart their thinking.
