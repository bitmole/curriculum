= Design Recipe Rubric

_Usage Note: This rubric captures the typical case in which students progress from naming only the function correctly to also getting the number of inputs and input types correct. Teachers should feel free to adapt the rubric to appropriately score students who make a mistake in the function name but have their rest of the work correct._

| Contract
|
* Contract contains the correct function name. 
* Contract has the correct number of Domain Data types.
* Contract has the correct data type(s) listed in the Domain.
* Contract has the correct  data type listed for the Range.
|
* Contract has the correct function name. 
* Contract has the correct number of Domain Data types.
* Contract has the correct data type(s) listed for the Domain or Range.
|
Contract contains the correct function name. 
|
The Contract is not left blank.

| Purpose Statement
|
* The Purpose Statement describes what the function consumes and produces.
* The Purpose Statement describes how the  result is computed, so that it can be combined to with the Contract to completely explain their examples (e.g. “Battling”).
|
The Purpose Statement describes what the function consumes *and* produces.
|
The Purpose Statement describes what the function consumes *or* produces.
|
The Purpose Statement is not left blank.  

| Examples
|
* All examples have the correct function name. 
* The inputs differ across the examples, and are appropriate to the problem.
* All examples have the correct number of Domain inputs. 
* There are correct expressions for what the function produces, using the different given inputs.  
* Changeable parts of the Examples are circled and labeled with a variable name and drawn from the purpose statement.  
* The Examples show how the result is computed, such that they can completely explain the Definitions (e.g. “Battling”).
* If the function is piecewise, students write examples for each possibility and can explain why a condition is necessary.
|
* All examples have the correct function name.
* The inputs differ across the examples, and are appropriate to the problem
|
All examples have the correct function name. 
|
Examples are not left blank.

| Definition
|
* The Definition has the correct function name, correct number, name, and order of variables (taken from the labels in the Examples section).
* The function body is consistent with the Examples.
* If the function is piecewise, it contains conditions that properly satisfy all examples.
|
The Definition has the correct function name, correct number, name, and order of variables (taken from the labels in the Examples section). 
|
The Definition has the correct function name. 
|
The Definition is not left blank.
