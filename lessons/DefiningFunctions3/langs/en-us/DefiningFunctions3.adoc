= Defining Functions 3 

@lesson-description{Students apply their skills in using the Design Recipe and writing purpose statements to a variety of word problems.}


[.left-header,cols="20a,80a", stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Understand how to use the @vocab{Design Recipe} to break down simple word problems.
* Create a strong @vocab{purpose statement} that details in their own words what the @vocab{function} is doing.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the Design Recipe to break down word problem when writing a function.
* I can identify @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and other quantities in a word problem when writing a function.
* I can create and revise a strong purpose statement that explains what the function is doing.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|

* The purpose statement, like the contract, is a comment - something that the computer doesn't read.  It's important for readability of their code - there may be other people looking at their code and using their functions!
* The domain and range of a function are described as @vocab{data types}, such as Number, String, or Image.
* If students struggle with getting started, encourage them to start with one example and use the Circles of Evaluation examples mapping organizer.  
* This activity can work well as a formative review. 
* This activity is a good time to get students working with someone other than their usual coding partner. 

|Prerequisites
|

* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
* Students should be familiar wih the Design Recipe.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme} 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"] 
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org} 
endif::[]
on their computer.

== Practice: (30 min)
Students will practice with the Design Recipe and writing quality Purpose Statements.  This can be done with their usual coding partner, a new partner, a station review, or another format that suits the class.

Students will use the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/PurposeStatement3ReadsStrongerClearer.pdf, Purpose Statement organizer} and the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DesignRecipe1.pdf, Design Recipe} worksheets to work through different problems from @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/WordProblems.pdf, Solving Word Problems}.

MLR 6: 3 Reads 
In pairs, the word problem is read 3 times. Students will document their work in the "3 Reads/Stronger & Clearer" handout.

* 1st Read: Teacher reads the word problem. Without any pencil or pen, students discuss: What is the problem about? 
* 2nd Read: Partner A reads. Students discuss: What are the quantities?
* 3rd Read: Partner B reads. What is a good purpose statement?

MLR 1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time 
Using the "3 Reads + Stronger & Clearer" handout, students will switch partners 3 times.

* 1st new partner: Read their purpose statements to each other & revise the purpose statement to be stronger and clearer.
* 2nd new partner: Repeat.
* 3rd new partner: Repeat.

Students may choose to use the programming environment to test out their functions or to solve solution disputes.  Encourage students to try different strategies and debug their own programs as much as possible.  

== Discuss: (5 min)

* *What strategies did you find the most helpful in solving these problems?*
+
_Encourage student discussion while making notes of preferred strategies on the board._
* *Did any groups disagree on how to solve a problem?  What did you do to resolve this?*
+
* *How can reading a word problem three times help you?
+
_Helps you to slow down and comprehend, makes time to look for information, gives you a chance to catch something you missed the first time, etc._
* *Where else can you use the strategies we practiced today?*

== Create: (10 min)

Ask students to create their own appropriately challenging word problem (with a solution) and collect the responses for later use as "Do Now" tasks or formative assessment.
