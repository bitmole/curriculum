= Threats to Validity

Data scientists conducted a study of *15,000 people living in
Alaska and New Mexico*. They wanted to find out if people in
colder climates spent more money on footwear. They discovered that
*Alaskans spent an average of $150 per year on shoes, whereas New
Mexicans spent an average of $45 per year*. 

Before publishing their findings, the data scientists have asked
you to review their claim. In the space below, indicate possible
