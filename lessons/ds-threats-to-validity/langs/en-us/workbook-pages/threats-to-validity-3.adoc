= Threats to Validity

The animal shelter wanted to find out what kind of food to buy for their animals. They
took a random sample of two animals and the food they eat, and they found that
spider and rabbit food was by far the most popular cuisine!

What are some possible threats to the validity of this conclusion?

A volunteer opens the shelter in the morning and walks all the dogs. At mid-day,
another volunteer feeds all the dogs and walks them again. In the evening, a third
volunteer walks the dogs a final time and closes the shelter. The volunteers report that
the dogs are much friendlier and more active at mid-day, so the shelter staff assume
the second volunteer must be better with animals then the others.
