= Threats to Validity


*Threats to Validity* can undermine a conclusion, even if the analysis was done
correctly. Some examples of threats are:


Selection bias:: identifying the favorite food of the rabbits won’t tell us
anything reliable about what all the animals eat.


Sample size::  averaging the age of only three animals won’t tell us anything
reliable about the age of animals at the shelter!


Sample error:: surveying dogs when they are puppies won’t tell us anything
reliable about overall dog behavior, since their behavior changes as they
age.



Confounding variables:: shelter workers might steer people towards newer
animals, because they’ve become attached to the animals that have been
there for a while, making it appear that “staying at the shelter longer” means
“less likely to be adopted”.
