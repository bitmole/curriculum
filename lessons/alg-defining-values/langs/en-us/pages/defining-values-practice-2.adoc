Using the `PRIZE_STAR` definition from above, draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the code for each of the exercises. One Circle of Evaluation has been done for you.


[cols="^1a,^1a", stripes="none"]

|A solid, green star that is 3 times 
@span{.clear}{}the size of the original (using `scale`)

|A solid, green star is half the size of the
original (using scale)
