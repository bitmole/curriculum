= Defining Values - Practice


1) On the line below, *write the code* to define `PRIZE-STAR` as a pink, outline star of size 65.

@span{.blankline}

Using the `PRIZE-STAR` definition from above, draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the code for each of the exercises. One Circle of Evaluation has been done for you.


[cols="^1a,^1a", stripes="none"]

| 2) The outline of a pink star that is 3 times 
@span{.clear}{}the size of the original (using `scale`)
--
@vspace{10ex}

@show{(sexp->coe '(scale 3 PRIZE-STAR))}

@vspace{18ex}

@span{.blankline}

|3) The outline of a pink star is half the 
@span{.clear}{}size of the original (using `scale`)

@vspace{40ex}

@span{.blankline}

|4)  The outline of a pink star of size 65 
@span{.clear}{}that has been rotated 45 degrees

@vspace{40ex}

@span{.blankline}

|5) The outline of a pink star that is 3 times the size of the original
 *and* has been rotated 45 degrees

@vspace{40ex}

@span{.blankline}
