|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Understand the need for coordinates in a video game.
* Estimate coordinates given a screen resolution.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can estimate coordinates given a specific screen resolution
* Collaborate with a partner to brainstorm a videogame
* Use Google Draw to create a mock-up Screenshot(proof of concept) of their video game.

|Key Points for the Facilitator

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, and pencil or pen. Students should be logged into WeScheme.

== Launch: (5 min)

Have students look at the Battleship Grid Image(without labels) and notice the hits and misses.  Ask students where they would fire next to try and hit one of the battleships.

== Discuss: (5 min)

* What can help us be more precise in playing Battleship?
* How do you think this concept relates to a videogame?

== Explore: (10 min) Ninja Cat Desmos Graph

In pairs, have students explore the Ninja Cat Desmos graph in the 3 different environments.

****
As one partner explores the graph, the other student will write down what they notice.

== Practice: (15 min) Estimation 180 Activity - Ninja Cat 

Have students practice their estimation skills and analyze their absolute error and percentage error along the way.

Talking Points
* Why do we estimate?
* What constitutes a good estimate?
* How can we improve our estimation skills?


== Create/Apply: (15 min) Brainstorm a Game - Google Draw
 
Students will brainstorm their video game and come up with a Player, Target, Danger, and Background.

Students will use this Google Draw template to create a Screenshot of their game by inserting images via Google Search.

Screenshot must include
* Labeled estimates of coordinates for each character.
* 2 characters that have the same x coordinate.
* 2 different characters that have the same y coordinate.
