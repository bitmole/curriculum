= Coordinates & Estimation

@lesson-description{Students review the importance and need for coordinates in a videogame and brainstorm a game of their own}


[.left-header,cols="20a,80a", stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Understand the need for coordinates in a video game
* Estimate coordinates given a screen resolution

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can estimate coordinates given a specific screen resolution
* Collaborate with a partner to brainstorm a videogame
* Use Google Draw to create a mock-up Screenshot(proof of concept) of their video game.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The launch activity should create and reinforce the need for coordinates and to attend to precision.
* Continue to use the same "Estimation" handout so students can track their pattern of estimation over time.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with the Coordinate Plane.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, and pencil or pen. Students should be logged into https://www.wescheme.org[WeScheme].

== Launch: (5 min)

Let's look at a game of "Hit or Miss." Have students notice and wonder about the Grid image below. 

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
****

* How would describe where the "hits" are?
* How would you describe where the "misses" are?
* Where would you guess next to get a "hit"?

[.text-center]
Hit or Miss

@image{images/HitOrMiss.png, Hit or Miss, 400, align="center"}

== Discuss: (5 min)

* What can help us be more precise in playing "Hit or Miss"?
* How do you think this concept relates to a videogame?

== Explore: (10 min) Ninja Cat Desmos Graph

In pairs, have students explore https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pbm9nxr2rd[the Ninja Cat Desmos graph].

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
As one partner explores the graph, the other student will write down what they notice.

== Practice: (15 min) Estimation 180 Activity - Ninja Cat 

Have students practice their estimation skills with this https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WObz4aczEfd7vqxAnfYwp1NT0OZ7cge8hWB2ESc_UUk/view[handout] and analyze their absolute error and percentage error along the way.

Talking Points

* Why do we estimate?
* What constitutes a good estimate?
* How can we improve our estimation skills?


== Create/Apply: (15 min) Brainstorm a Game - Google Draw
 
Students will https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gM5eqfI-VVzccr_3-UugZWOvYKYKYd_wrOrFyOKoQ0o/edit?usp=sharing[brainstorm their video game] and decide on a Player, Target, Danger, and Background.

Students will use https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ET8OazCiswbHrx8wyUAsSkcPRcsKC8xVoOJAc1YFKVE/copy[this Google Draw template] to create a Screenshot of their game by inserting images via Google Search.

Screenshot must include

* Labeled estimates of coordinates for each character.
* 2 characters that have the same x coordinate.
* 2 different characters that have the same y coordinate.
