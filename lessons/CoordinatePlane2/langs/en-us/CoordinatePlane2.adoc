= Coordinates & Estimation

@lesson-description{Students review the importance and need for coordinates in the context of a video game and brainstorm a game of their own.}


[.left-header,cols="20a,80a", stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Explain the need for @vocab{coordinates} in a given situation.
* Estimate coordinates in a bounded area.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can estimate the positions of objects using coordinates.
* I can collaborate with a partner to brainstorm a video game.
* I can create a sample mock-up (proof of concept) of my video game.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The launch activity should create and reinforce the need for coordinates and to attend to precision.
* Continue to use the same "Estimation" handout so students can track their pattern of estimation over time.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with the @vocab{coordinate plane}.

== Get Ready:

Students should be logged into 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme }
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org }
endif::[]
and have their workbooks with a pen or pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

Let's look at a game of "Hit or Miss." Have students notice and wonder about the Grid image below. 

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
What do you notice? What do you wonder?
****

* How would describe where the "hits" are?
* How would you describe where the "misses" are?
* Where would you guess next to get a "hit"?

[.text-center]
Hit or Miss

@image{images/HitOrMiss.png, Hit or Miss, 400, align="center"}

_As students discuss, let them reach the consensus themselves about the need for coordinates!_

== Discuss: (5 min)

* What can help us be more precise in playing "Hit or Miss"? _A system for describing exactly where we want to go, like coordinates!_
* How do you think this concept relates to a videogame? _Answers vary: we need to know where characters are on the screen, we need a way for players to interact with certain parts of the screen, etc_

== Explore: (10 min) 


In pairs, have students explore the @link{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pbm9nxr2rd, Ninja Cat Desmos graph}.


[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
As one partner explores the graph, the other student will write down what they notice.

== Practice: (15 min) 

=== Estimation 180 Activity

Have students practice their estimation skills with this @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/Estimation.pdf, Estimation handout} and analyze their absolute error and percentage error along the way.

== Discuss II:

* Why do we estimate? _Practice number sense, get better at working with numbers_
* What constitutes a good estimate? 
* How can we improve our estimation skills? _Practice, get more comfortable with numbers and more comfortable with making guesses_


== Create/Apply: (15 min) 
 
Students will complete the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/BrainstormGame1.pdf, "Brainstorm Your Own Game"} worksheet and decide on a Player, Target, Danger, and Background for their game.  


Students will use a @link{https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ET8OazCiswbHrx8wyUAsSkcPRcsKC8xVoOJAc1YFKVE/copy, Google Draw template} (click "Make a copy" when prompted) to create a sample "screenshot" of their game by inserting images via Google Search.


Screenshot should include:

* Labeled estimates of coordinates for each character.
* 2 characters that have the same x-coordinate.
* 2 different characters that have the same y-coordinate.
