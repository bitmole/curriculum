= Triangle Contracts

@n What kind of triangle does the `triangle` function produce?  @fitb{15em}{@show{(if *solutions-mode?* "_equilateral_" "")}}
@vspace{1ex}

There are lots of other kinds of triangles! Here are contracts for some of the other triangle functions in @ifproglang{pyret}{pyret} @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme}.

```
triangle :: number, string, string -> image
right-triangle :: number, number, string, string -> image
isosceles-triangle :: number, number, string, string -> image
triangle-sas :: number, number, number, number, string, string -> image
triangle-asa :: number, number, number, number, string, string -> image
```

WHAT SHOULD WE DO NEXT?

- Have students write example expressions that approximately produce a given set of images?

- Matching activity, where they connect expressions to images?

- Provide the contracts in expanded form where they have to describe variables and write example expressions?

@n When you write @show{(sexp->code `(triangle 80 "solid" "red"))}, the function is using code supplied by the programmer who wrote the original `triangle` function. *What other numbers besides 80 do you think the function is using to build the triangle?*

Be sure to add your favorite examples of each of the triangle functions to your contracts pages!
