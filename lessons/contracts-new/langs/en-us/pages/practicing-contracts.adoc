Consider the following contract:

----
rotate :: (degree :: Number, img :: Image) -> Image
----

What is the *Name* of this function? @fitb{39em}{}

@vspace{1ex}

How many things are in this function's  *Domain*? @fitb{33em}{}

@vspace{1ex}

What is the *type* of this function's  *first argument*? @fitb{32em}{}

@vspace{1ex}

What is the *name* of this function's  *second argument*? @fitb{30em}{}

@vspace{1ex}

What is the *Range* of this function? @fitb{38em}{} 

@vspace{1ex}

Circle the expression below that shows the correct application of this function, based on its contract.

@vspace{1ex}

1. `rotate(45, 90)`

2. `rotate(circle(99, "solid", "green"))`

3. `rotate(25, rectangle(7, 10, "outline", "black"))`

4. `rotate(rectangle(7, 10, "outline", "black"), 25)`

@vspace{1ex}

Consider the following contract:

----
text :: (str :: String, size :: Number, color :: String) -> Image
----

What is the *Name* of this function? @fitb{15em}{}

How may things are in this function's *Domain*? @fitb{10em}{}

What is the *type* of this function's *first argument*?
@fitb{10em}{}

What is the *name* of this function's *second argument*?
@fitb{10em}{}

What is the *Range* of this function? @fitb{15em}{}.

Below, circle which expression is the correct application of this function, based on its contract.

1. `text("Bootstrap:Data Science", "purple", 60)`

2. `text(circle(99, "solid", "green"))`

3. `text("red", 25, "Andrew")`

4. `text("Angela", 25, "purple")`
