== Applying Functions @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to apply functions in 
	@ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret} 
	@ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme}, 
reinforcing concepts from standard Algebra, and practice reading error messages to diagnose errors in code.

=== Launch
Students know about Numbers, Strings, 
	@ifproglang{pyret}{Booleans and Operators} 
	@ifproglang{wescheme}{and Booleans}
-- all of which behave just like they do in math. But what about @vocab{functions}? Students may remember functions from algebra: @math{f(x) = x + 4}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- What is the name of this function? _f_
- The expression @math{f(2)} applies the function @math{f} to the number 2. What will it evaluate to? _6_
- What will the expression @math{f(3)} evaluate to? _7_
- The values to which we apply a function are called its @vocab{arguments}. How many arguments does @math{f} expect? _1_

@vocab{Arguments} (or "inputs") are the values passed into a function. This is different from _variables_, which are the placeholders that get _replaced_ with input values! Pyret has lots of built-in functions, which we can use to write more interesting programs. 

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Have students log into  
@ifproglang{pyret}{@link{https://code.pyret.org, "code.pyret.org CPO"}}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{@link{https://wescheme.org, WeScheme}}
and open the editor. 
Have students type @show{(sexp->code `(sqrt 16))} into the interactions area and hit Enter.

- What is the name of this function? @ifproglang{pyret}{`num-sqrt`} @ifproglang{wescheme}{`sqrt`}
- What did the expression evaluate to? _4_
- Does the @ifproglang{pyret}{`num-sqrt`} @ifproglang{wescheme}{`sqrt`} function produce a Number? String? Boolean? _Number_
- How many @vocab{arguments} does the function expect? _1_

Have students type @show{(sexp->code `(string-length "rainbow"))} into the interactions area and hit Enter: 

- What is the name of this function? _string-length_
- What does the expression evaluate to? _7_
- Does the `string-length` function produce a Number? String? Boolean? _Number_
- How many @vocab{arguments} does `string-length` expect? _1_
--

=== Investigation
[.lesson-instruction]
@ifproglang{pyret}{
- On Line 1 of the @vocab{Definitions area} (left side), type the words *include image* and press "Run". (This loads the *image* library.)
}
Have students complete @printable-exercise{pages/applying-functions.adoc} in which they will investigate the expression @show{(sexp->code `(triangle 50 "solid" "red"))} and a series of error messages. As students finish, have them try making other triangles using `"outline"` for the second argument and changing the size and color! 

=== Synthesize
Debrief the activity with the class. 

- What are the types of the arguments `triangle` was expecting? _A Number and 2 Strings_
- How does the output relate to the inputs? _The Number determines the size and the Strings determine the style and color._
- What kind of value was produced by that expression? _An Image! New datatype!_ 
- Which error messages did you encounter?

== Contracts @duration{35 minutes}

=== Overview

This activity introduces the notion of @vocab{Contracts}, which are a simple notation for keeping track of the set of all possible inputs and outputs for a function. They are also closely related to the concept of a _function machine_, which is introduced as well. __Note: Contracts are based on the same notation found in Algebra!__

=== Launch

When students typed @show{(sexp->code `(triangle 50 "solid" "red"))} 
into the editor, they created an example of a new Datatype, called an _Image_.

The `triangle` function can make lots of different triangles! The size, style and color are all determined by the specific inputs provided in the code, but, if we don't provide the function with a number and two strings to define those parameters, we will get an error message instead of a triangle.

As you can imagine, there are many other functions for making images, each with a different set of arguments. For each of these functions, we need to keep track of three things:

. *Name* -- the name of the function, which we type in whenever we want to use it
. *Domain* -- the type of data we give to the function (names and
  Types!), written between parentheses and separated by commas
. *Range* -- the type of data the function produces

The @vocab{Name}, @vocab{Domain} and @vocab{Range} are use to write a @vocab{Contract}.

Where else have you heard the word "contract"?  How can you connect that meaning to contracts in programming?

_An actor signs a contract agreeing to perform in a film in exchange for compensation, a contractor makes an agreement with a homeowner to build or repair something in a set amount of time for compensation, or a parent agrees to pizza for dinner in exchange for the child completing their chores. Similarly, a contract in programming is an *agreement* between what the function is given and what it produces._

*Contracts tell us a lot about how to use a function.* In fact, we can figure out how to use functions we've never seen before, just by looking at the contract! Most of the time, error messages occur when we've accidentally broken a contract.

Contracts don't tell us _specific_ inputs. They tell us the _@vocab{Datatype}_ of input a function needs. For example, a Contract wouldn’t say that addition requires "3 and 4". Addition works on more than just those two inputs! Instead, it would tells us that addition requires "two Numbers". When we _use_ a Contract, we plug specific numbers or strings into the expression we are coding.

[.lesson-point]
Contracts are general. Expressions are specific.

[.lesson-instruction]
*Optional:* Have students make a @printable-exercise{pages/frayer-model.pdf, Domain and Range Frayer model} and use the visual organizer to explain the concepts of Domain and Range in their own words.

Let’s take a look at the Name, Domain, and Range of the functions we've seen before:

[.text-center]
*A Sample Contracts Table*

}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
|`#` `num-sqr`			| ::| `Number`  			|	->	| `Number`
|`#` `num-sqrt`			| ::| `Number` 				|	->	| `Number`
|`#` `string-length`	| ::| `String`				|	->	| `Number`
|`#` `triangle`			| ::| `Number String String`|	->	| `Image`
}
|===

[.lesson-point]
When the input matches what the function consumes, the function produces the output we expect.

Memorizing contracts is hard, and why memorize when we can just keep a log of them! Let's write them down so we can use them later! At the back of your workbook, you'll find pages with space to write down every contract you see in this course and space to record code for an example expression that satisfies each function.

Open the editor and write code for expressions that satisfy the contracts for each of these functions. 

@ifproglang{wescheme}{ `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, `sqrt` and `string-length`
	}
	@ifproglang{pyret}{ `num-sqr`, `num-sqrt`, and `string-length`
	}

When you've got working expressions, *record the code in the empty line beneath each contract*. These pages will become your reference for the remainder of the class!

Here are two more examples of functions. 

@show{(sexp->code `(string-contains? "apples, pears, milk" "pears"))}
@show{(sexp->code `(string-append "sun" "shine"))}

Type the code into the Interactions Area to see what it does. Can you figure out the contract, based on the example? _String, String -> Boolean_

Once you figure it out, add it to your contracts page!

=== Synthesize

- What is the difference between a value like `17` and a type like `Number`?
- For each expression where a function is given inputs, how many outputs are there? _For each collection of inputs that we give a function there is exactly one output._


== Exploring Image Functions & Writing Contracts @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
This activity digs deeper into Contracts, and has students create their own Contracts trackers to take ownership of the concept and create an artifact they can refer back to.  Students explore functions, producing all sorts of simple geometric shapes and images in the process. Making images is highly motivating, and encourages students to get better at both reading error messages and persisting in catching bugs.

@span{.title}{Error Messages}

The error messages in this environment are _designed_ to be as student-friendly as possible. Encourage students to read these messages aloud to one another, and ask them what they think the error message _means_. By explicitly drawing their attention to errors, you will be setting them up to be more independent in the next activity!
|===

How to diagnose and fix errors is a skill you will be developing throughout this class. Some of these errors will be _syntax errors_: a missing comma, an unclosed string, etc. All the other errors are _contract errors_. If you see an error and you know the syntax is right, ask yourself these two questions:

- What is the function that is generating that error?
- What is the contract for that function?
- Is the function getting what it needs, according to its Domain?

Suppose we had never seen `star` before. How could we figure out how to use it, using the helpful error messages?

- Type `star` into the Interactions Area and hit "Enter". What did you get back? What does that mean? _There is something called "star", and the computer knows it's a function!_

- If it's a function, we know that it will need an open parentheses and at least one input. Have students try @show{(sexp->code `(star 50))} 

- What error did we get? What _hint_ does it give us about how to use this function? _`star` has three elements in its Domain_

- What happens if I don't give it those things?
_We won't get the star we want, we'll probably get an error!_

- If I give `star` what it needs, what do I get in return?
_An Image of the star that matches the arguments_

- What is the contract for star?  _Star : Number String String : Image_

- The contract for `square` also has Number String String as the Domain and Image as the Range. Does that mean the contracts the same? _No! The domain and range are the same, but the function name is different... and that's important because the `star` function does something very different with the inputs given than what the `square` function does!_

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Have students turn to the contracts pages in the back of their workbook and experiment in the editor to write code and figure out contracts for each of the shapes whose functions are listed. (If needed, you can print a copy of these @link{../../resources/contracts.pdf, contracts pages}.

MLR 2 - Collect and Display: As students explore, walk the room and record student language relating to functions, domain, range, contracts, or what they perceive from @vocab{error messages}.  This output can be used for a concept map, which can be updated and built upon, bridging student language with disciplinary language while increasing sense-making.
|===

=== Synthesize

- `square` and `star` have the same domain (number string string). Did you find any other shape functions with the same `domain` and `range`? _Yes! `triangle` and `circle`._
- A lot of the `domains` for shape functions are the same, but some are different. Why did some shape functions need more inputs than others? 

	* _The `triangle` function draws equilateral triangles and all equilateral triangles have three 60 degree angles and 3 equal sides, so one number for the size of the triangle is enough._
	* _Squares have four equal sides and all angles are 90 degrees, so one number for the size is enough._
	* _The `rectangle` function makes rectangles of many different proportions. Some are long and skinny. Some have lengths and widths that are much closer together.  When the ratio of the length and width are adjustable like this, the `function` needs to know both dimensions._

- Did any of the functions you explored require numbers that described something other than the size of the shape?
	* _Some of the functions take in the number of sides of a shape or angle measures._

- What error messages did you see? _Input mismatches, missing parentheses, etc._
- How did you figure out what to do after seeing an error message? _Read the error message, think about what the computer is trying to tell us, etc._

You’ve learned about Numbers, Strings, Booleans, and Images. You’ve learned about operators and functions, and how they can be used to make shapes, strings, and more! You are now familiar with the fundamental concepts needed to write simple programs. @ifpathway{data-science}{You will have many opportunities to use these concepts in this course, by writing programs to answer data science questions.}

--
- Can different functions have the same Domain? _yes. `square` and `star` have the same Domain._
- The same Range? _yes. The range for all of the polygons was `image`._

== Using Contracts increases efficiency @duration{10minutes}

=== Overview

Students are given contracts for some more interesting image functions and see how much more efficient it is to write code when starting with a contract.

=== Launch

You just investigated image functions by guessing and checking what the contract might be and responding to error messages until the shapes built. If you'd started with a contract, it would have been a lot easier!

=== Investigate

I AM GOING TO WAIT TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS UNTIL WE HAVE AGREED ON WHETHER CONTRACTS WILL JUST INCLUDE DATATYPES OR ALSO INCLUDE VARIABLES. I WANT THERE TO BE A WORKBOOK PAGE THAT ASKS MORE DIRECT QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE 4 FUNCTIONS AND INCLUDES SOME IMAGES FOR INSPIRATION RATHER THAN BEING DEPENDENT ON THE TEACHER TO PROVIDE THEM. SINCE THIS IS ABOUT READING CONTRACTS, QUESTION STRUCTURE WILL DEPEND ON WHAT INFORMATION STUDENTS ARE BEING GIVEN.

- Text: String String String : Image
- Rhombus: Number Number String String : Image
- Ellipse: Number Number String String : Image
- Radial-star : Number Number Number String String : Image

[.lesson-instruction]
- Have students turn to @printable-exercise{pages/using-contracts.adoc} and use their editors to experiment. 
- Once they've discovered how to build a version of each image function that satisfies them, have them record the example code in their contracts table. See if you can figure out what aspect of the image each of the inputs specifies. It may help you to jot down some notes about your discoveries. We will be sharing our findings later.

=== Synthesize

Make sure that all students have completed the shape functions in their contracts pages with both contracts and example code so they have something to refer back to.

- Which input determined the size of the Rhombus?  What did the other number input determine?
- For some of you, the word ellipse was new. How would you describe what an ellipse looks like to someone who'd never seen one before?  Why did the contract for ellipse require to numbers? What happens when the two numbers are the same?

=== Possible Misconceptions

Students are _very_ likely to randomly experiment, rather than to actually use the Contracts. You should plan to ask lots of direct questions to make sure students are making this connection, such as:

- How many items are in this function's Domain?
- What is the _name_ of the 1st item in this function's Domain?
- What is the _type_ of the 1st item in this function's Domain?
- What is the _type_ of the Range?
