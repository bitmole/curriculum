. A `pie-chart` showing the `species` of fixed animals at the shelter.
. A `bar-chart` showing the `gender` of cats at the shelter.
. A `pie-chart` showing the how many cats are fixed or not.
. A `bar-chart` showing the how many cats are young or not.
. A `histogram` of the number of `pounds` that cats weigh.
. A `box-plot` of the number of `weeks` that it takes fixed animals to be adopted.
. A `histogram` of the number of `weeks` that it takes young animals be adopted.
. A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `age` as the y-axis, for all the cats at the shelter.
. A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the fixed animals at the shelter.
. A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the young animals at the shelter.
. (Challenge) An `lr-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the fixed cats at the shelter.
