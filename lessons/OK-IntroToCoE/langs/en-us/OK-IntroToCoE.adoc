This lesson introduces students to Circles of Evaluation, a visual tool that provides structure for understanding the order of operations and programming syntax.  Pyret doesn’t assume the traditional PEMDAS order of operations, so students have to be explicit in what order they want the computer to use. +
{empty} +
[underline]#This lesson can be taught with or without the use of computers, depending on your preference and/or computer availability.#

== Warm Up: 10 minutes
=== Notice and Wonder

==== Narrative

The purpose of Notice and Wonder is to explicitly give students time to let their brains process what they’re doing and not feel pressured to come up with an answer or response right away.  Once students have gotten used to this procedure, they begin to do it naturally on their own.  “Notice” responses are usually factual observations, such as colors, physical locations, buttons, etc.  “Wonder” responses are usually questions, such as “How can I…?”, “Will we…?”, “Why is…?”, etc. +
{empty} +
Student will spend about one minute “Noticing” and one minute “Wondering”.  After discussing the Notice and Wonder responses, they will practice translating math expressions into Circles of Evaluation and then into Pyret syntax.

==== Launch

Display the following images: +
{empty} +

@image{images/CoE1.png, Pyret Sign In Page, 800, align="center"}

==== Student Task
1. Take 1-2 minutes to record observations (Notice) with your partner about this new programming environment.  Investigate what you see.  What do you notice?
+
Have students share what they noticed and display their responses.

2. Take 1-2 minutes to record questions (Wonder) with your partner about the programming environment.  What do you wonder?
+
Have students share what they wondered and display their responses.

==== Synthesis (5 minutes)

Ask students to reflect on the Notice and Wonder responses and respond to each other.

To involve more students in the conversation, consider asking:

* *"Who else noticed this?"*
* *"Did anyone have a Wonder that was related to a Notice?"*
* *"Who else wondered this?"* +
* *“Did anyone try anything that might answer _____’s Wonder?”* +
* *“I noticed that you and your partner tried _______. Can you tell us about that?”* +

== Activity 1: 15 Minutes
=== Matching Circles to Expressions

==== Narrative

The purpose of this activity is for students to get practice and build fluency in moving between math notation and Circles of Evaluation.  In this activity, they will match cards containing math expressions in common notation to cards with Circles of Evaluation on them.  One of the math expressions cards and one of the Circles of Evaluation cards will not have a match, and students will need to create a match for those.  This is the first time students are encountering Circles of Evaluation, which will be used frequently throughout subsequent lessons, so plenty of time for practice is recommended. +
{empty} +

The difficulty of this activity can be increased by providing more challenging math expressions, fewer matches, or by not providing the set of Circle cards at all and having students draw them independently.

==== Launch

Allow for 10 minutes of partner work and 5 minutes of class discussion.  Walk the room to observe student progress and help solve technical issues where needed.

==== Student Task

Your teacher will give you two sets of cards: one containing math expressions in common notation and one containing Circles of Evaluation like the ones we just saw.

. Match each number card with a letter card.
. One of the math cards and one of the Circle of Evaluation cards will not have a match. For those cards, write what the match would be.
. What is the connection between the number of Circles and the number of operators?

==== Student Response

==== Anticipated Misconceptions

Students might not right away see the usefulness of Circles of Evaluation if they’re already skilled in the use of parentheses and the order of operations.  However, as the programming elements get more complex, Circles of Evaluation will be increasingly useful.  Encourage students who need an extra challenge to create more complicated Circles of Evaluation to challenge each other (or you!)

==== Synthesis

Ask students to pair-share how they read the Circles and decided on matches.  Did they read from the inside to the outside?  Outside to the inside?  Which way seems more logical to them?  How many Circles could they theoretically nest together?

== Activity 2: 15 minutes
=== Translating Circles to Code

==== Narrative

The purpose of this activity is for students to practice translating Circles of Evaluation into Pyret code.  Students will be given a set of Circles of Evaluation and will write what they think the correct syntax would be for each one.  When each partner is done, they’ll switch and check each other’s work, asking questions and explaining when necessary.  If using computers, students can try typing the code into Pyret to check.  However, students should remember that just because something computes doesn’t mean it’s the correct model!  Encourage discourse and ask students questions about their thinking. +
{empty} +
Blank space is provided at the bottom of each page for students to create their own Circle of Evaluation to challenge their partner. +

==== Launch

Hand out “Translating Circles to Code” worksheets A & B to each pair of students.

==== Student Task

Translate the Circles of Evaluation into Pyret code with your partner.

. You may use Pyret to type in the code if you wish, however, remember that just because Pyret completes the calculation doesn’t guarantee it’s right!  Be sure to check the model.
. Create a challenge Circle of Evaluation in the space provided for your partner to try.

==== Synthesis

Ask students to reflect on which task they found easier - translating math notation into Circles of Evaluation, or translating Circles of Evaluation into Pyret code?  Why do they think that is?

==== Ready for More?

Students may be curious about how to square or take the square root of numbers.  The syntax for these two is a bit different than for operators: +
{empty} +
`num-sqr(9)` will produce 81.
`num-sqrt(64)` will produce 8. +
{empty} +
The Circles of Evaluation for these are:

When students are ready for more, they can investigate these two new functions and do some noticing about why these functions look a bit different.  There are two supplemental worksheets provided for practicing with these in addition to what was learned in this lesson.

== Summary
In this lesson, students encountered Circles of Evaluation for the first time.  They learned how to translate common math notation into the Circle of Evaluation format and be explicit in what order the math operations will be performed in.  They then practiced translating Circles of Evaluation into Pyret code. +
{empty} +
In future lessons, these skills will be used frequently with increasingly complex functions and expressions.  If students are struggling, be sure to spend another class period giving students practice time.

== Cool Down: 5 minutes
=== Switcheroo

==== Narrative

Some students tend to work Circles of Evaluation from the inside-out, while others start on the outside and work their way in.  Students think about which strategy they’ve been using, then try the opposite strategy.  This exercise helps strengthen student understanding by looking at the problem through a new perspective and applying their knowledge differently.

==== Launch

Ask students to reflect on “circles within circles” and think about how they approach them.  Do they start on the outside and work their way in?  Do they start on the inside and work their way out?  Does their partner use the same strategy? +
{empty} +
Give students the following math expression and ask them to employ the opposite strategy.
{empty} +

==== Student-Facing Task Statement

Think about how you approach Circles of Evaluation.  Do you start from the inside, or the outside?  What about your partner?  Do you think one strategy has advantages over the other? +
{empty} +
Translate this math expression into a Circle of Evaluation, using the opposite strategy you used before.

How did it feel to try a new strategy?  Did you feel like you preferred the new way, or the previous way?  How does trying new strategies to strengthen our brains?
