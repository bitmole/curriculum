| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet
* link:{pathwayrootdir}/workbook/workbook.pdf[Student workbook], and something to write with
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Graphing Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=XYZ, open a new one}

| Supplemental Resources
| In a more programming-focused course, or if appropriate for your learning goals, students can learn to write piecewise functions in the @link{../ds-if-expressions/index.shtml, If-Expressions} lesson. 

| Key Points for the Facilitator
| This lesson is designed to feel almost _eerily_ similar to @link{../ds-tables-and-functions/index.shtml, Tables and Functions}. __This is entirely purposeful__. Teachers should not be afraid make explicit references to this, driving home the fact that Tables, Functions and Graphs are all connected.

== Representing Functions as Graphs @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students consider graphs as another representation of functions.

=== Launch
Take a look at the following linear function (shown as Pyret code and regular algebra) and Graph:

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a"]
|===
| `fun f(x): 2 * x end`

@math{f(x) = 2x}

| @image{images/2x.png}

|===

* What do you *Notice*?
* What do you *Wonder*?

There's a definite connection between the function and the graph. If we apply this linear function to any point on the x-axis, it produces the y-value that falls on the line. Instead of drawing endless points repeating the same pattern, we can just declare the pattern itself using the function.

=== Synthesize
For graphs that fit a pattern like this, a function can be a much shorter way of describing all of the points on the graph! In fact, a one-line function can summarize an _infinite_ number of points.


== Not all Graphs come from Functions @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _build_ graphs with functions, and that not all graphs can be generated from linear functions.

=== Launch
We've provided a special function `make-graph` that takes in a starting point, an ending point, the size of the steps between them, and a function. It produces a __graph__ with those steps as x-coordinates and the output of the function as the y-coordinates. For example:

```
fun f(x): 0.5 * x end
# make a table with xs going from 0-10 in steps of 2
make-graph(0, 10, 2, f)
```

will produce:

[.lesson-instruction]
* How could we change this code to make a graph for *all* the points between 0 and 10, instead of skipping by 2? 
* How could we change this code to make a graph for all the points between 20 and 200, skipping by 10? 
* How could we change this code to make a graph for a different function altogether? 
* Open the Table and Graphs Starter File, and try defining different functions and using them to build Tables.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
* Complete @workbook-link{define-functions-graphs.adoc}.
* What are some graphs that can't be made from linear functions?

_Any_ graph constructed from a linear function will have points that precisely follow a straight-line pattern. But not every graph follows a pattern like that! Can you tell which is which?

[.lesson-instruction]
Open @workbook-link{linear-or-not.adoc}. Which of these tables can be summarized by a linear function? Which ones can't?
