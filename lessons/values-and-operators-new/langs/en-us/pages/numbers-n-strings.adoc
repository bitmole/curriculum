Make sure you’ve loaded the @ifproglang{wescheme}{wescheme.org} @ifproglang{pyret}{code.pyret.org} editor, clicked “Run”, and are working in the `Interactions Area`.

== Numbers

. Try typing `42` into the Interactions Area and hitting “Enter”.  What is the largest number the editor can handle?
. Try typing `0.5`. Then try typing `.5`. Then try clicking on the answer. Experiment with other decimals. 

. Explain what you understand about how decimals work in this programming language.

. What happens if you try a fraction like `1/3`? 
 @span{.blankline}{}

. Try writing negative integers, fractions and decimals.

== Strings

String values are always in quotes. 

. Is _42_ the same as `"42"`? Why or why not? Write your answer below:
 @span{.blankline}{}
. Try typing your name (in quotes!). 
. Try typing a sentence like "I'm excited to learn to code!" in quotes.
. Try typing your name with the opening quote, but _without_ the closing quote. What does the error message say?
 @span{.blankline}{}
. Now try typing your name without any quotes. 
. Explain what you understand about how strings work in this programming language.

== Operators

. Just like math, Pyret has *operators* like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. Try typing in `4 + 2`, and then `4+2` (without the spaces). What can you conclude from this?

. Type in the following expressions, one at a time: `4 + 2 + 6`, `4 + 2 * 6`, `4 + (2 * 6)`. What do you notice?
@span{.blankline}{}

. Try typing in `4 + "cat"`, and then `"dog" + "cat"`. What can you conclude from this? +
