= Vidoe Game Project

@description{Students build a videogame of their own design! Every game must have a player (their avatar), a danger (something to avoid), and a target (something to chase). Students build their world using function composition, animate their characters through linear functions, detect boundaries with compound inequalities, and detect collisions with the distance formula. This project can be extended into more complex movement (quadratic, exponential, trigonometric) and "cheat codes".}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to...

* share their completed videogame with friends and family to play!
* recognize meaningful applications of inequalities, functions, and the distance formula, answering the all important questions, "When will I ever use...?!"
* express their creativity through the design of a game context

| Student-facing Lesson Goals
|

* I can code my own videogame!

== Project Overview

This Project is the capstone project of Bootstrap:Algebra.

Once students have completed x, y, z they will be prepared to begin working with the @starter-file{game}.

Completion of the project is scaffolded through Design Recipe Exercises in the following lessons:

- x
- y
- z

Students who are already familiar with Circles of Evaluation, Simple Datatypes and Functions can complete this project in about a week. You can expect student engagement to be high! Many Bootstrap teachers have found great success with dedicating time to this project in advance of a holiday.
