= Samples from the Animals Dataset

How can we define subsets? For a given row `r`, what function
will identify if that row is in the subset? We’ve given you the
solution for the first subset, to get you started.

| Subset
| A function that returns true if a row `r` is in the subset

| Kittens (<2 years old)
|
----
fun is-kitten(r):

  (r["age"] < 2) and (r["species"] == "cat")
  
end
----

| Puppies (<2 years old)
|
----
fun is-puppy(r):



end

fun is-fixed-cat(r):
