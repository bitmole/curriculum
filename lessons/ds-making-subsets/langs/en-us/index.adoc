= Making Subsets

@lesson-description{Students learn about logical and random subsets, and practive creating them from the animals dataset. In the process, they practice using the Design Recipe to create filter functions, and come up with questions they wish to explore. Finally, students select a dataset of their own.}

== Warmup (Time 10 minutes)

Open your saved animals-dataset file. You should have several functions defined:

- `is-fixed`
- `gender`
- `is-cat`
- `is-young`

If you didn’t have a chance to type them in from your workbook, make sure you do!

[.lesson-instruction]
Take 10m and write a function `is-dog`, then type it into the Definitions Area.

== Making Subsets (Time 20 minutes)

=== Overview
This activity is all about _representative samples_: how well does a subset of one population represent the whole population? Students make a bunch of subsets from the animals dataset, then see how each of those subsets differs in response to the same question.

=== Launch
Suppose we want to survey Americans and try to predict who our next president will be. It would take too long to ask everyone who they’re voting for, so pollsters instead take a _sample_ of Americans, and _generalize_ the opinion of the sample to estimate how Americans as a whole feel. But choosing a sample can be tricky...

[.lesson-instruction]
* Would it be problematic to only call voters who are registered Democrats? To only call voters under 25? To only call regular churchgoers? Why or why not?
* Suppose we are interested how in women feel about a particular issue. Should we still make sure we’re surveying men, too? Why or why not?

Sampling is a complicated issue! Depending on the question we want to answer, we often want carve out a subset of the data (e.g. calling only women, calling a random sample of 2000 people, etc). Sometimes we want to create a _random sample_ of an existing table. 

[.lesson-instruction]
--
Type the following code into the Definitions Area (left-hand side of your screen), and click “Run”.
----
tiny-sample  = random-rows(animals-table, 3)
small-sample = random-rows(animals-table, 8)
----
* What do you get when you evaluate `tiny-sample` in the Interactions Area? `small-sample`?
* What is the contract for `random-rows`? What does the function do?
--

[.lesson-point]
Make subsets first!

Data Scientists don’t always know what the interesting questions are right away. So whenever they explore a dataset, one of the first things do is define some _logical subsets_, just to have them handy later. Someone looking at our animals dataset might want to consider “just the lizards” or “just males”. This also helps them reason about the data, without being biased by a particular question.

=== Student-Facing Task Assessment
[.lesson-instruction]
--
A “kitten” is an animal whose `species == "cat"` and whose `age < 2`. How would you make a subset of just kittens?

* Turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/samples-from-animals-dataset.adoc}, and see what code will compute whether or not an animal is a kitten. 
* Can you fill in the code for the other subsets? 
* When you're done, type these definitions into the Definitions Area
--

We already know how to define values, and how to filter a dataset. So let’s define some subsets, in addition to the random samples we just made:
----
dogs  = animals-table.filter(is-dog)
cats  = animals-table.filter(is-cat)
fixed = animals-table.filter(is-fixed)
young = animals-table.filter(is-young)
----


[.lesson-instruction]
--
Make a pie-chart showing how many of each species is in the shelter, by writing `pie-chart(animals-table, "species")`. Which of our subsets do you think will give us the most accurate approximation of the original chart?
----
pie-chart(dogs, "species")
pie-chart(cats, "species")
pie-chart(fixed, "species")
pie-chart(young, "species")
pie-chart(tiny-sample, "species")
pie-chart(small-sample, "species")
----
Compare the charts you get from each of these. Which one is the most representative of the whole population? Why?

== Choose Your Dataset (Time 20 minutes)

=== Overview
Students browse through the library of provided datasets, and choose one they want to work with. NOTE: this can also be done as a homework assignment, if all students have internet access at home.

=== Launch
Explain to students that they will now select a dataset for them to work with for the remainder of the course. Make sure they understand that it genuinely has to be something they are interested in - their engagement with the data is critical to engaging with the class.

_Students can also find their own dataset_, and use this (@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=112j5-gF_BLpDWI_qzgaOseOhp6YbteD8, Blank Starter file}). See this @link{https://youtu.be/K4n9hTSqcyw, tutorial video} for help importing your own data into Pyret.

[.lesson-point]
Students must have at least 2 questions that are both _interesting_ and _answerable_ using their dataset.

=== Student-Facing Task Assessment

[.lesson-instruction]
Choose a dataset that is interesting to you! You should have at least two questions that the dataset can help you answer. Write these questions down on @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/whats-on-your-mind.adoc}.

== Collect
Have students share their datasets and their questions.

For the rest of this course, students will be learning new programming and Data Science skills, practicing them with the Animals dataset and then applying them to their own data.
