= Defining Values

@lesson-description{Students learn how to define lines of code as a set value that can be used repeatedly in different situations, similar to a variable in math.}

[@lesson-intro-table]
|===
@prereqs-stds{FunctionComposition1}
| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of @vocab{variable}s and why they are useful in math and programming

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can define a line of code as a @vocab{value}, such as `myStar` or `eyeColor`.
* I can use my defined value in different situations.

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Learning how to define values is a big milestone! It will be used consistently throughout other lessons, so be sure to give students plenty of time to practice this new skill.
* Check frequently for understanding of @vocab{data types} and @vocab{contract}s during this lesson and throughout subsequent lessons.

* Students will use their Contracts page frequently, so it should be kept in an accessible, convenient location.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.

== Get Ready:

Students should be logged into
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org}.
endif::[]

== Launch: (5 mins)
Display the sample code from the "Prize Star" exercise.

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]

`(star 50 "solid" "green")`

`(scale 3 (star 50 "solid" "green"))`

`(scale .5 (star 50 "solid" "green"))`

`(rotate 45 (star 50 "solid" "green"))`

`(rotate 45 (scale 3 (star 50 "solid" "green")))`

* *What common element was repeated throughout all the lines of code?*
+
`_(star 50 "solid" "green")_`

* *What happened when you were asked to change the color of the star to gold?*
+
_We had to change it everywhere it appeared._
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`star(50, "solid", "green")`

`scale(3, star(50, "solid", "green"))`

`scale(0.5, star(50, "solid", "green"))`

`rotate(45, star(50, "solid", "green"))`

`rotate(45, scale(3, star(50, "solid", "green")))`

* *What common element was repeated throughout all the lines of code?*
+
`_star(50, "solid", "green")_`

* *What happened when you were asked to change the color of the star to gold?*
+
_We had to change it everywhere it appeared._
endif::[]

=== Since we're using that star over and over again, wouldn't it be nice if we could give that piece of code a "nickname", something shorter we could type to represent that piece of code?

== Explore: (10 mins)
In the coding environment, have students click "Start a new program" and open to @workbook-link{pages/DefiningValues-WB1.pdf, Defining Values - Explore} to explore defining values.

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Students need to have *include image* as their first line of code in the @vocab{Definitions area} and press "Run" to load the image library.
endif::[]

== Discuss: (10 mins)
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* *How is ‘define’ similar to a function?  How is it different?*
+
_It’s written inside parentheses like a @vocab{function}, but ‘define’ doesn’t have an output_
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* *How is defining a value with the `=` sign similar to what you've seen in math class?
endif::[]

* *What is the usefulness of defining values?*
+
_Lets the programmer reuse code, saves time, lets the programmer make changes easily, allows us to more easily use elements inside other functions_
* *What datatypes can we define values for?*
+
_All of them - Number, String, Image_

MLR 8 - Discussion Supports: As students discuss, rephrase responses as questions and encourage precision in the words being used to reinforce the meanings behind some of the programming-specific language, such as "define" and "value".

== Practice: (10 mins)
Students complete @workbook-link{pages/DefiningValues-WB2.pdf, Defining Values Practice} with their partner.

Student-facing task:

* Write the code for a solid, green `star` of size 50 and define it as `PRIZE_STAR`

Use PRIZE_STAR to complete the following exercises:

* a solid, green `star` that’s 3 times as large as the original (using the `scale` function)
* a solid, green `star` that’s ½ the size of the original( using the `scale` function)
* a solid, green `star` of size 50 that’s rotated 45 degrees (using the `rotate` function)
* a solid, green `star` that’s 3 times as large as the original and rotated 45 degrees

== Create/Apply: (15 mins)

There are other functions that also work with Images - `overlay`, `beside`, and `above` are all functions that take in two Images and return a new Image. +
{empty} +

*Option 1* (for a shorter time commitment):
Define at least 3 images of your own and combine using `overlay`, `beside`, and/or `above`.  You can also use any other functions you've learned, such as:

* `rotate`
* `scale`
* `flip-horizontal`
* `flip-vertical`
* any other image producing function(`triangle`, `star`, `circle`, `rectangle`, etc..)

Write comments to describe what is being produced. +
{empty} +

*Option 2* (for a longer time commitment):
Have students choose a flag from this list: @workbook-link{pages/flags-of-the-world-resource.pdf, (Flags of the World Resource)}, and recreate one (or more!) of the flags using `define` and any of the other functions they've learned so far.
