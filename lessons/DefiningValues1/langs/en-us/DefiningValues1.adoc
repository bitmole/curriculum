= Defining Values

*Students learn how to define lines of code as a set value that can be used repeatedly in different situations, similar to a variable in math.*

|===
| Lesson Goals 
| Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of @vocab{variable}s and why they are useful in math and programming 

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can define a line of code as a value, such as `myStar` or `eyeColor`.
* I can use my defined value in different situations.

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Check frequently for understanding of @vocab{datatype}s and @vocab{contract}s during this lesson and throughout subsequent lessons.

* Students will use their Contracts page frequently, so it should be kept in an accessible, convenient location.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.


|Materials
|
* Workbook, writing utensil, computer

== Get Ready: 

Students should be logged into WeScheme.

== Launch: (5 mins)
Display sample code from the "Prize Star" exercise (Lesson 2c) visible to students.  

What common element was repeated throughout all the lines of code? `_(star 50 "solid" "green")_`

What happened when you were asked to change the color of the star to gold? _Had to change it everywhere it appeared_  



== Explore: (10 mins)
Students open the “Exploring Define” file and use the commented directions there to explore the new ‘define’ keyword.


== Discuss: (10 mins)
* How is ‘define’ similar to a function?  How is it different? 
_It’s written inside parentheses like a function, ‘define’ must be given a value name and a function call (a circle of eval), but ‘define’ doesn’t have an output_
* What is the usefulness of defining values? 
_Lets the programmer reuse code, saves time, lets the programmer make changes easily, allows us to more easily use elements inside other functions_
* What datatypes can we define values for? 
_All of them - Number, String, Image_

MLR 8 - Discussion Supports: As students discuss, rephrase responses as questions and encourage precision in the words being used to reinforce the meanings behind some of the programming-specific language, such as "define" and "value".

== Practice: (10 mins)
Students complete the workbook page with their partner.

Student-facing task:

* Write the code for a solid, green `star` of size 50 and define it as `PRIZE_STAR`

Use PRIZE_STAR to complete the following exercises:

* a solid, green `star` that’s 3 times as large as the original (using the `scale` function)
* a solid, green `star` that’s ½ the size of the original( using the `scale` function)
* a solid, green `star` of size 50 that’s rotated 45 degrees (using the `rotate` function)
* a solid, green `star` that’s 3 times as large as the original and rotated 45 degrees

== Create/Apply: (15 mins) 

*Option 1*:
Define a least 3 values that uses the text function and at least 3 of following functions:

* `rotate`
* `scale`
* `overlay`
* `flip-horizontal`
* `flip-vertical`
* any other image producing function(`triangle`, `star`, `circle`, `rectangle`, etc..)

Write comments to describe what is being produced.

*Option 2*:
Have students choose a flag from this list _link_ and recreate the flag using define and any of the functions they've learned so far.
