| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Describe the solution set of a simple inequality
* Explain the 'Boolean' datatype

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain to someone else what a Boolean is.
* I can find solutions and non solutions to an inequality.

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Number, or Image, but unlike the others there are only two values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
* Functions that produce Booleans are typically questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions.
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
For example, `safe-left?`, `onscreen?` are both functions that are asking if a condition, such as an image being on the screen, is true or false.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `safe-left?` and `safe-right?`.

== Introducing Booleans @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover the concept of inequalities (or apply it, if they've seen it before) in programming, and extend their knowledge of data types, Contracts, and Circles of Evaluation.

=== Launch
Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }
and have their workbooks with a pen or pencil.

Ask students to evaluate Circles of Evaluation for simple expressions they've seen before, and ask them to convert them into code.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(+ 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(- 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(* 8 0))}

Then show them unfamiliar Circles of Evaluation, and ask them to hypothesize what they think they means, what they will evaluate to, and what the code would look like.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(> 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(< 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(= 8 0))}

Have students convert these Circles to code and type them in. What did they evaluate to? What do they think the output means?

Values like `true` and `false` obviously aren't Numbers or Images. But they also aren't Strings, or else they would have quotes around them. We've found a __new datatype__, called a @vocab{Boolean}. Booleans are the answers to any yes-or-no question (for example: "Is five greater than two?", "Did a character hit a wall?", etc.)

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Have students open to the @workbook-link{pages/booleans-intro.adoc} worksheet and complete with a partner.

=== Synthesize
- Students will see functions on the worksheet that they've never encountered before! But instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Many students - especially traditionally high-achieving ones - will be very concerned about writing examples that are "wrong." The misconception here is that an expression that produces `false` is somehow _incorrect_. You can preempt this in advance, by explaining that our Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_.
