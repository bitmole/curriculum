For each of the game screenshots below, write the code to calculate the distance between the indicated characters. _Refer to Distance from Game Coordinates for an Example._

@centered-image{../images/game-3.png, "Screenshot of a game. A right triangle connects a cyclist and the cop that's chasing him. The position of the cyclist is (170,400). The position of the cop is (525,300)"}

@fitb{}{
@showsoln{(code '(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length 525 170)) (sqr (line-length 320 400)))))}
}

@fitb{}{}


@centered-image{../images/game-4.png,  "Screenshot of a game. A right triangle connects a cyclist and the chicken he's chasing. The position of the cyclist is (385, 110). The position of the chicken is (230,390)."}

@fitb{}{
@showsoln{(code '(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length 385 230)) (sqr (line-length 110 390)))))}
}
