= Displaying Categorical Data

@vspace{1ex}

Data Scientists use *displays* to visualize data. You've probably seen some of these charts, graphs and plots yourselves! When it comes to displaying *Categorical Data*, we often rely on *bar charts* and *pie charts*. CODAP, however, only has the capacity to create *bar charts*.

. *Bar charts* show the _count or percentage_ of rows in each category.
* Bar charts provide a visual representation of the frequency of values in a categorical column. 
* Bar charts have a bar for every category in a column.
* The more rows in a category, the taller the bar.
* Bars in a bar chart can be show in _any order_, without changing the meaning of the chart. However, bars are usually shown in some sensible order (bars for the number of orders for different t-shirt sizes might be presented in order of smallest to largest shirt).
