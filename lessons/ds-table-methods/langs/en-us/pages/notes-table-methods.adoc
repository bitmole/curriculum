= Defining Row Functions &amp; Using Table Methods

*Methods* are special functions that are attached to pieces of data. We use them to manipulate Tables. They are different from functions in several ways:

- Their names can’t be used alone: they can only be used as part of data, separated by a dot (for example, `shapes.row-n(2)`).

- Their contracts are different: they include the type of the data as part of their names. 
+ 
(E.g.,  `<table>.row-n {two-colons} (index {two-colons} Number) -> Row`.)

- They have a “secret” argument, which is the data they are attached to.

- In this course, the methods we’ll be using are  

** `row-n` - consumes an index (starting with zero!) and produces a row from a table
** `order-by` - consumes the name of a column and a Boolean value to determine if that table should be sorted by that column in ascending order.
** `filter` - consumes a __Boolean-producing function__, and produces a table containing only rows for which the function returns `true`.
** `build-column` - consumes the name of a new column, and a function that produces the values in that column for each Row.
