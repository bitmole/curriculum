| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet
* link:{pathwayrootdir}/workbook/workbook.pdf[Student workbook], and something to write with
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Graphing Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=XYZ, open a new one}

| Key Points for the Facilitator
| This lesson is about two big ideas:

* Linear relationships, as defined by slope and y-intercept
* Matching representations of Tables and Graphs

== Connecting Tables with Graphs @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students consider graphs as an alternate representation of tables.

=== Launch
Take a look at the following Table and Graph:

[cols="^.^1a,^.^1a", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
|

[.pyret-table.first-table,cols="1,1",options="header"]
!===
! x ! y
! 0 ! 0
! 1 ! 2
! 2 ! 4
! 3 ! 6
! 4 ! 8
!===
| @image{images/2x.png}

|===
[.lesson-instruction]
* What do you *Notice*?
* What do you *Wonder*?

There's a definite connection between the graph and the table. Each x/y-point on the graph represents a row in the Table.

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you predict the next two rows in the table? Could you extend the line on the graph? __How did you arrive at your prediction?__

=== Investigate
All graphs are made of points, each of which has an x- and a y-coordinate. For any graph, we can list any number of x's and their matching y's as rows in a table.

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note}

To encourage students to look at the _points_ in the table and graph, it is useful to change the scale of the graphs so that all lines look the same. This prevents students from leaning on visual cues like "steepness" to bypass the learning objective.

It can also be useful to list the points in the table __out of order__, both to focus students' attention on the points and to drive home that rows do not have to be ordered!
|===

[.lesson-point]
Axes on a graph have an order. Rows in a table don't have to be listed in any particular order!

The rows in a table are _discrete_, meaning they preserve their meaning if the rows are shuffled into a different order. *Some* tables represent a pattern. Ordering the rows in a table can make it easier for us to recognize patterns.

On a graph of a line, the points on are _not_ discrete, and cannot be shuffled. Lines have properties that depend on order, like @vocab{slope}. Graphs can be stretched or squished by changing the scale of the axis. This can make the lines _look_ different, but the points will always be in the same order.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Can you match tables and graphs, even if the rows are shuffled and the axes are changed? Complete @exercise-link{pages/match-tables-graphs2.adoc}.

=== Synthesize
Tables only show us _some points_ on a line, whereas a line itself is made up of an _infinite_ number of points. When a table represents a _sample_ of some larger trend, the graph is a way of seeing the trend itself.

== Linear vs. Non-linear

=== Overview
Students explore the concept of linearity, identifying properties like @vocab{slope} (or @vocab{rate}) and @vocab{y-intercept}  and "starting value") in both tables and graphs.

=== Launch
There is a pattern in each of the tables below. Can you figure out what the next row should be? When reading these tables, you can think of the "x" column as counting the rows. The first row has x=1, the second has x=2, and so on. Each of the "y" columns is some kind of pattern. For each pattern, can you guess the next row in the table? Can you guess what the y-value would be when x is 0?

| [.sideways-pyret-table]
|===
| x | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
| y | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
|===

| [.sideways-pyret-table]
|===
| x |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5
| y | 12 | 14 | 16 | 18 | 20
|===

| [.sideways-pyret-table]
|===
| x |  1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
| y | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6
|===

Each of these patterns has two properties. They all increase at a consistent @vocab{rate}, growing by the same amount (growing by 1, by 2, and by -1). They also have a @vocab{y-intercept}, which is the y-value when x = 0.

*Note:* Rows in a table don't have to be ordered! In a table that represents a pattern, you may have to _sort_ the rows in order to see the pattern emerge. 

These properties also show up if we view that pattern as a line on a graph. When graphed, the rate is called the @vocab{slope} of the line. And the point where x = 0 is also the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This is why mathematicians call it the @vocab{y-intercept}!

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note}

There is nothing "magical" about the @vocab{y-intercept}! It's just a convention that mathematicians use, since graphs don't have a "starting value". They could have arbitrarily picked some other point, like "the point where the line crosses -2735.1", and the only change to the way we teach linear functions would be a vocabulary word!
|===

== Investigate
Can you identify these two properties in a table? In a graph?

[.lesson-point]
The graph of a linear relationship will always appear as a straight line.  An ordered table of values for any linear relationship will reveal a constant rate of change.

There are other kinds of patterns, which don't have a rate/slope. Can you figure out the next number in the patterns below?

* 1, 4, 9, 16, 25
* 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25
* -10, -6, -1, 6, 15

These patterns are @vocab{nonlinear} patterns. When graphed, they don't look like straight lines at all!

And of course, sometimes there _is_ no pattern. Sometimes the numbers are truly random! A graph can only have one y-value for each x-value, so a table with repeated x-values but different y-values can't be part of a pattern.

=== Synthesize

Data has a "shape", and this shape can emerge when we look for patterns in that data. A linear, straight-line relationship is one kind of shape, and it shows up when we view that data as a table or a graph.
