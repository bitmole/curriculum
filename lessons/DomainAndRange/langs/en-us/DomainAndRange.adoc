= Domain and Range (Contracts)

@lesson-description{Students encounter String and Image datatypes and use "contracts" to make sense of the domain and range of functions.}

[.left-header, cols="20a, 80a", stripes=none]
|===
| Lesson Goals 
| Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and how they relate to @vocab{functions}

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can identify the domain and range of a function.
* I can identify the data types Number, String, and Image

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Check frequently for understanding of @vocab{data types} and @vocab{contract}s during this lesson and throughout subsequent lessons.

* Students will use their Contracts page frequently, so it should be kept in an accessible, convenient location.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready: 

Students should be logged in and have their Contracts page ready.


== Launch: (5 mins)
Have a Circle of Evaluation up in front of students.  *What will this evaluate to?*

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Show a line of code: `(* 10 -4)`.  *What will this evaluate to?*

Show another line of code: `(star 50 “solid” “blue”)`.  *What will this evaluate to?*
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Show a line of code: `10 * -4`.  *What will this evaluate to?*

Show another line of code: `star(50, “solid”, “blue”)`.  *What will this evaluate to?*
endif::[]
 


== Explore: (10 mins)
Have students turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DomainAndRange-WB1.pdf, "Exploring Image Functions"}. 

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Have students open a new program file and name it "Exploring Images".
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* Have students open a new program file and name it "Exploring Images".  

* On Line 1 of the Definitions window (left side), type the words *include image* and press "Run". (This loads the *image* library.)
endif::[]


Give students time to investigate image functions and see how many they can discover, using the workbook page to organize their findings.

MLR 2 - Collect and Display: As students explore, walk the room and record student language relating to functions,
domain, range, contracts, or what they perceive from error messages.  This output can be used for a concept map, which 
can be updated and built upon, bridging student language with disciplinary language while increasing sense-making.
****

== Discuss: (10 mins)
* *What image functions did you and your partner discover?* 
+
_``rectangle``, `triangle`, `ellipse`, `circle`, etc._
* *How did you decide what to try?*
* *What error messages did you see?*
+
_Input mismatches, missing parentheses, etc._
* *How did you figure out what to do after seeing an error message?* 
+
_Read the error message, think about what the computer is trying to tell us, etc._

=== Every contract has three important parts: the function's name, what it consumes, and what it produces.

* *How else could we refer to what a function consumes?* 
+
_Input, what it 'takes in', arguments_

* *How else could we refer to what a function produces?* 
+
_Output, what it 'gives back', what the function evaluates to_

=== Functions have different requirements, so we need to be able to keep track of them.  We refer to what a function expects as the "domain" and what the function produces as the "range". 

Have students turn to the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DomainAndRange-WB2.pdf, Domain and Range Frayer models} in their workbooks and use the visual organizer to explain the concepts of domain and range in their own words.

* *Group together the image functions you discovered by elements in their domain.*
+
_``star``, `circle`, and `triangle` have the same domain, `rectangle` and `ellipse` have the same domain, etc._

* *`star` has three elements in its domain: A Number, a String, and another String.  What do these elements represent?*
+
_The Number is the radius, the first String is the style (either `outline` or `solid`), the second String is the color._
* *What happens if I don't give it those things?*
+
_We won't get the star we want, we'll probably get an error!_
* *If I give `star` what it needs, what do I get in return?*
+
_An Image of the star that matches the arguments_
* *`square` has the same Domain as `star`.  What do the arguments in `square` represent?*
+
_length, style, color_
* *Can different functions have the same Domain?  The same Range?  Are they still different functions?* 
+
_Yes, yes, and yes!_
* *Can we up with an example of two math functions that have the same Domain and Range?*

=== When the input matches what the function expects, the function gives back the output we expect.  We call this agreement a "contract".

* *Where else have you heard the word "contract"?  How can you connect that meaning to contracts in programming?* 
+
_An actor signs a contract agreeing to perform in a film in exchange for compensation, a contractor makes an agreement with a homeowner to build or repair something in a set amount of time for compensation, or a parent agrees to pizza for dinner in exchange for the child completing their chores. Similarly, a contract in programming is an *agreement* between what the function is given and what it produces._

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* *What does the contract for `star` look like?*
+
_``star: Number String String -> Image``_
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* *What does the contract for `star` look like?*
+
_``star: Number, String, String -> Image``_
endif::[]

== Practice: (10 mins)

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Students complete @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DomainAndRange-WB3.pdf, "Domain and Range - Practice"} with their partner.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Students complete @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DomainAndRange-WB3.pdf, "Domain and Range - Practice"} with their partner.
endif::[]

@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DomainAndRange-Practice1.pdf, Domain and Range Practice 1} and @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DomainAndRange-Practice2.pdf, Domain and Range Practice 2} are provided for additional practice with writing contracts.

== Create: (10 mins) 

Students create a visual "Contracts page" either digitally or physically.  Ask students to think about how they visualize contracts in their own minds and how they could use that imagery to explain functions and their contracts to others.
