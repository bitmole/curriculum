= BSA: G2b - Domain and Range (Contracts)
== Students encounter String and Image datatypes and use 'contracts' to make sense of the domain and range of functions.

|===
| Lesson Goals 
|Students will be able to:
|
* Demonstrate understanding of domain and range and how they relate to functions

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can identify the domain and range of a function.
* I can identify the datatypes Number, String, and Image

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Check frequently for understanding of datatypes and contracts during this lesson and throughout subsequent lessons.

* Students will use their Contracts page frequently, so it should be kept in an accessible, convenient location.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready: 

Students should be logged into WeScheme.

== Launch: (8 mins)
Have a Circle of Evaluation up in front of students.  What will this evaluate to?

Show a line of code: (* 10 -4).  What will this evaluate to?

Show another line of code: (star 50 “solid” “blue”).  What will this evaluate to? 

== Explore: (10 mins)
Give students time to investigate image functions and see how many they can discover.

MLR 2 - Collect and Display: As students explore, walk the room and record student language relating to functions,
domain, range, contracts, or what they perceive from error messages.  This output can be used for a concept map, which 
can be updated and built upon, bridging student language with disciplinary language while increasing sense-making.
***

== Discuss: (10 mins)
* What image functions did you and your partner discover?
* How did you decide what to try?
* What error messages did you see?
* How did you figure out what to do after seeing an error?  
* Group together the image functions you discovered by elements in their domain.

* Star has three elements in its domain: A Number, a String, and another String.  What do these elements represent?
* What does star need in order to work?  What happens if I don't give it those things?
* If I give star what it needs, what do I get in return?

== Practice: (10 mins)
Students complete workbook page __ with their partner.

== Create/Apply: (15 mins)
