= Domain and Range (Contracts)

@lesson-description{Students encounter String and Image datatypes and use "contracts" to make sense of the domain and range of functions.}

[@lesson-intro-table]
|===
@prereqs-stds{OrderOfOperations1}
| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and how they relate to @vocab{functions}

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can identify the domain and range of a function.
* I can identify the data types @vocab{Number}, @vocab{String}, and @vocab{Image}

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Check frequently for understanding of @vocab{data types} and @vocab{contract}s during this lesson and throughout subsequent lessons.

* Students will use their Contracts page frequently, so it should be kept in an accessible, convenient location.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.

== Warmup

Students should be logged in and have their @vocab{Contracts} page ready.

== Exploring Image Functions @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore functions that go beyond numbers, producing all sorts of simple geometric shapes and images in the process. Making images is highly motivating, and encourages students to get better at both reading error messages and persisting in catching bugs.

=== Launch
Have a Circle of Evaluation up in front of students. _What will this evaluate to?_

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Show a line of code: `(* 10 -4)`.  _What will this evaluate to?_
Show another line of code: `(star 50 “solid” “blue”)`.  _What will this evaluate to?_
endif::[]

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Show a line of code: `10 * -4`.  _What will this evaluate to?_
Show another line of code: `star(50, “solid”, “blue”)`.  _What will this evaluate to?_
endif::[]

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Have students turn to @workbook-link{pages/DomainAndRange-WB1.pdf, "Exploring Image Functions"}.
- Have students open a new program file and name it "Exploring Images".
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
- On Line 1 of the @vocab{Definitions area} (left side), type the words *include image* and press "Run". (This loads the *image* library.)
endif::[]

Give students time to investigate image functions and see how many they can discover, using the workbook page to organize their findings.

MLR 2 - Collect and Display: As students explore, walk the room and record student language relating to functions, domain, range, contracts, or what they perceive from @vocab{error messages}.  This output can be used for a concept map, which can be updated and built upon, bridging student language with disciplinary language while increasing sense-making.
****

=== Synthesize
- *What image functions did you and your partner discover?*
``rectangle``, `triangle`, `ellipse`, `circle`, etc.
- *How did you decide what to try?*
- *What error messages did you see?*
_Input mismatches, missing parentheses, etc._
- *How did you figure out what to do after seeing an error message?*
_Read the error message, think about what the computer is trying to tell us, etc._

== Contracts @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
After experimenting with image-producing functions, students have begun to realize that each function needs different inputs. Remembering all of these can be challenging! This activity introduces the notion of @vocab{Contracts}, which are a simple notation (found in algebra) for keeping track of the set all of possible inputs and outputs for a function.

=== Launch
Keeping track of how many inputs a function needs - and whether those inputs are Numbers, Strings, Images, etc. In programming, we use something called a @vocab{Contract} to do this. Contracts are like a "cheat sheet" for using functions. Once you know how to read one, you can quickly figure out how to use a function just by looking at its contract.

[.lesson-point]
A function's contract has three parts: the Name, the @vocab{Domain}, and the @vocab{Range}

- The Name is simply how we refer to the function: `circle`, `star`, etc.
- The @vocab{Domain} tells us what the function "takes in", or _consumes_. These also known as the _arguments_ to the function.
- The @vocab{Range} tells us what the function "gives back", _produces_.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
- Write the contracts for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, and `sqrt` into the Contracts page.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
- Write the contracts for `num-sqr`, and `num-sqrt` into the Contracts page.
endif::[]

[.text-center]
Contracts

endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@centered-image{images/Contracts-Pyret.jpg, Contracts, 400, align="center"}
endif::[] 

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students turn to the @workbook-link{pages/DomainAndRange-WB2.pdf, Domain and Range Frayer models} in their workbooks and use the visual organizer to explain the concepts of domain and range in their own words.

- *Group together the image functions you discovered by elements in their domain.*

_`star`, `circle`, and `triangle` have the same Domain, `rectangle` and `ellipse` have the same domain, etc._

== Making Sense of Contracts @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
This activity digs deeper into Contracts, and has students create their own Contracts trackers to take ownership of the concept and create an artifact they can refer back to.

== Launch

- `star` has three elements in its Domain: A Number, a String, and another String.  What do these elements represent?
_The Number is the radius, the first String is the style (either `outline` or `solid`), the second String is the color._

- *What happens if I don't give it those things?*
_We won't get the star we want, we'll probably get an error!_

- *If I give `star` what it needs, what do I get in return?*
_An Image of the star that matches the arguments_

- *`square` has the same Domain as `star`.  What do the arguments in `square` represent?*
_length, style, color_

- *Can different functions have the same Domain?  The same Range?  Are they still different functions?*
_Yes, yes, and yes!_

- *Can we up with an example of two math functions that have the same Domain and Range?*

[.lesson-point]
When the input matches what the function consumes, the function produces the output we expect. 

*Where else have you heard the word "contract"?  How can you connect that meaning to contracts in programming?*

_An actor signs a contract agreeing to perform in a film in exchange for compensation, a contractor makes an agreement with a homeowner to build or repair something in a set amount of time for compensation, or a parent agrees to pizza for dinner in exchange for the child completing their chores. Similarly, a contract in programming is an *agreement* between what the function is given and what it produces._

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
- *What does the contract for `star` look like?*
`star : Number String String -> Image`
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
- *What does the contract for `star` look like?*
`star {two-colons} Number, String, String -> Image`
endif::[]

=== Investigate

- Students complete @workbook-link{pages/DomainAndRange-WB3.pdf, "Domain and Range - Practice"} with their partner. @workbook-link{pages/DomainAndRange-Practice1.adoc, Domain and Range Practice 1} and @workbook-link{pages/DomainAndRange-Practice2.adoc, Domain and Range Practice 2} are provided for additional practice with writing contracts.

[.lesson-instruction]
Students create a visual "Contracts page" either digitally or physically.  Ask students to think about how they visualize contracts in their own minds and how they could use that imagery to explain functions and their contracts to others.
