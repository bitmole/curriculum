= Shape of My Dataset

1: The column I chose to measure is @fitb{15ex}{}.

.Measures of Center
--
The three measures for this column are:

[cols='3',options='header']
|===

| Mean (Average) | Median | Mode(s)

| @span{.vskip}{} ||
|===
--

2- Since the mean is @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[higher/lower]} than the median,
this suggests there may be outliers or skewness due to values
that are unusually @fitbruby{10ex}{}{[high/low]}.

.Measures of Spread
--
My five-number summary is:

[cols='5',options='header]

|===

| Minimum | Q1 | Q2 (Median) | Q3 | Maximum

| @span{.vskip}{} ||||

A box plot can be drawn from this summary on the number line
below

@span{.blankline}{}

From this summary and box plot, I conclude:
