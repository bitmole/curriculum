== Row and Column Lookups @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to access individual rows from a table in Pyret, and how to access a particular column from those rows.

=== Launch
Students open @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1PTPxKGyUfsMpy4GzFtYS_JGntiHOL0Yu, Animals Starter File -- Part 2}, save a copy, and click “Run”. This is the same program they've seen before, but with one extra line of code. Ask them which line is new, and what they think it does.

Tables have special functions associated with them, called @vocab{Methods}, which allow us to do all sorts of things with those tables. For example, we can get the first data row in a table by using the `.row-n` method: `animals-table.row-n(0)`

[.lesson-point]
Don't forget: data rows start at index _zero_!

[.lesson-instruction]
For practice, in the Interactions Area, use the `row-n` method to get the second and third data rows.

What is the Domain of .row-n? What is the Range? Find the contract for this method in your contracts table. A table @vocab{method} is a special kind of function which always operates on a specific table. In our example, we always use .row-n with the animals table, so the number we pass in is always used to grab a particular row from animals-table.

Pyret also has a way for us to get at individual columns of a Row, by using a Row Accessor. Row accessors start with a Row value, followed by square brackets and the name of the column where the value can be found. Here are three examples that use row accessors to get at different columns from the first row in the animals-table:

  animals-table.row-n(0)["name"]
  animals-table.row-n(0)["age"]
  animals-table.row-n(0)["fixed"]

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- How would you get the `weeks` column out of the _second_ row? The third?
- Complete the exercises on @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/lookup-questions.adoc} and @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/more-practice-w-lookups.adoc}.

We can use the `row-n` method to define entire _animal rows_ as values. Type the following lines of code into the Definitions Area and click “Run”:

  animalA = animals-table.row-n(1)
  animalB = animals-table.row-n(10)

What happens when you evaluate `animalA` in the Interactions Area?

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Define _at least_ two additional values to be animals from the `animals-table`, called `animalC` and `animalD`.


=== Synthesize
Have students share their answers, and see if there are any common questions that arise.


=== Closing

Congratulations! You’ve explored the Animals dataset, formulated your own questions and begun to think critically about the connections between data and the questions we ask about it. For the rest of this course, you’ll be learning new programming and Data Science skills, practicing them with the Animals dataset and then applying them to your own data.
