= Numbers and Strings

Make sure you’ve loaded the @ifproglang{wescheme}{wescheme.org} @ifproglang{pyret}{code.pyret.org} editor, clicked “Run”, and are working in the `Interactions Area`.

== Numbers

@n Try typing `42` into the Interactions Area and hitting “Enter”.  What is the largest number the editor can handle? @fitb{2ex}{}
@n Try typing `0.5`. Then try typing `.5`. Then try clicking on the answer. Experiment with other decimals. Explain what you understand about how decimals work in this programming language.
 @span{.blankline}{}
 @span{.blankline}{}

@n What happens if you try a fraction like `1/3`? 
 @span{.blankline}{}

@n Try writing negative integers, fractions and decimals.

== Strings

String values are always in quotes. 

@n Is `42` the same as `"42"`? Why or why not? Write your answer below:
 @span{.blankline}{}
@n Try typing your name (in quotes!). 
@n Try typing a sentence like "I'm excited to learn to code!" in quotes.
@n Try typing your name with the opening quote, but _without_ the closing quote. What does the error message say?
 @span{.blankline}{}
@n Now try typing your name without any quotes. 
@n Explain what you understand about how strings work in this programming language.

@ifproglang{pyret}{

== Operators

@n Just like math, Pyret has *operators* like `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`. Try typing in `4 + 2`, and then `4+2` (without the spaces). What can you conclude from this? 
@span{.blankline}{}
@n Type in the following expressions, one at a time: `4 + 2 + 6`, `4 + 2 * 6`, `4 + (2 * 6)`. What do you notice?
@span{.blankline}{}
@n Try typing in `4 + "cat"`, and then `"dog" + "cat"`. What can you conclude from this? +
@span{.blankline}{}
