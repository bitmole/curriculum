= Using Histograms

@lesson-description{Students explore new visualizations in Pyret,
this time focusing on the frequency of observations in a
quantitative dataset. Students are introduced to Histograms
by comparing them to bar charts, and learn to construct them
by hand and in Pyret.}

== Review (Time 20 minutes)

[.lesson-instruction]
Open your Animals Starter File, and click “Run”. (If you do not
have this file, or if something has happened to it, you can
always make a
@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1gaYAyYhvlKBm6VJuvJDcnoINBw76pL-L,
new copy}.)

Let’s get some more practice working with the Design Recipe, as we prepare to do more complex analysis.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/design-recipe.adoc}, and
write the functions you see there. When you’re ready, type the
contracts, purpose statements, examples and definitions into the
Definitions Area.

[.lesson-instruction]
Use the `.build-column` method to add a new column to the animals
table, showing the weight of every animal in kilograms.

== Introducing Histograms (Time 20 minutes)

[.lesson-instruction]
Let’s explore two different ways of visualizing data. Complete
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/summarizing-columns.adoc}.

Have students share their observations.

@vocab{Bar charts}, like the one of the bottom-left of
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/reading-histograms.adoc}, use the
horizontal axis to show values of a categorical variable (in the
diagram on the right, species). The vertical axis here shows
@vocab{frequency} of that value in the dataset, which can be shown as
absolute numbers or percentages of the total.

This bar chart happens to show the categorical values in
alphabetical order from left to right, but it would be perfectly
fine to re-order them any way we wish. For instance, the bar for
“dogs” could have been drawn before the one for “cats”. Unlike
the numbers on a histogram’s horizontal axis, there is no
objective order to categories on a bar-chart’s horizontal axis.
For this reason, _it never makes sense to talk about the “shape”
of a categorical data set_.

The display on the bottom-right is called a @vocab{histogram}.
Histograms show the distribution of _quantitative_ data. Since
quantitative data can be ordered from smallest-to-largest,
histograms allow us to see the shape of a data set.

Animal shelters make decisions about food, capacity and policies
based on how long it takes for animals to be adopted. But looking
at each value in the weeks column is tedious, and isn’t always
the easiest way to make sense of the data. As the saying goes,
sometimes you “can’t see the forest for the trees”. Summarizing
with a single number like the average alsi leaves out a lot of
important information. So instead of talking about each
individual in a dataset, or simply reporting the average for all
those individuals, Data Scientists find it useful to describe the
overall *shape* of the data.

A display of how long it takes animals to get adopted can make it
easier to get an idea of what adoption times were most common,
and if there were any unusually long or short times that it took
for an animal to be adopted. Let’s take a look at a histogram of
the weeks it takes an animal to be adopted. Type the following
into the interactions area:

----
histogram(animals-table, "weeks", 5)
----

[.lesson-instruction]
Look at the histogram and count how many animals took between 0
and 5 weeks to be adopted. How many took between 5 and 10 weeks?
What else do you Notice? What do you Wonder?

Display this histogram for students to see.

What do you Notice about this histogram? What can you conclude?
Here are a few conclusions to get you started:

- Because we see most of the histogram’s area encompassed by the
  two bars between 0 and 10 weeks, we can say it was most common
  for an animal to be adopted in 10 weeks or less.
- Because we see a small amount of the histogram’s area trailing
  out to unusually high values, we can say that a couple of
  animals took an unusually long time to be adopted: one took
  even more than 30 weeks.
- More than half of the animals (17 out of 31) took just 5 weeks
  or less to be adopted. But those few unusually long adoption
  times pulled the average up to 5.8 weeks. Knowing about the
  shape gives us worthwhile information beyond the simple report
  of average.

If someone would ask us what was typical for the adoption times,
we might say: “Almost all of the animals were adopted in 10 weeks
or less, but a couple of animals took an unusually long time to
be adopted -- even more than 20 or 30 weeks!” Without looking at
the histogram’s shape, it would have been very difficult to make
this summary.

[.lesson-instruction]
What would the histogram look like if most of the animals took
more than 20 weeks to be adopted, but a couple of them were
adopted in fewer than 5 weeks?

== Closing (Time 5 minutes)

[.lesson-instruction]
Histograms are a powerful way to display a data set and assess
its @vocab{shape}. But shape is just one of three key aspects that tell
us what’s going on with a quantitative data set. In the next
unit, we’ll explore the other two: center and spread.
