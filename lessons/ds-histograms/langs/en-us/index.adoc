= Using Histograms

@lesson-description{Students explore new visualizations in Pyret, this time focusing on the frequency of observations in a quantitative dataset. Students are introduced to Histograms by comparing them to bar charts, and learn to construct them by hand and in Pyret.}

== Review (Time 20 minutes)

Have students open their Animals Starter File, and click “Run”. (If they do not have this file, or if something has happened to it, they can always make a @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1gaYAyYhvlKBm6VJuvJDcnoINBw76pL-L, new copy}.)


[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/design-recipe.adoc}, and write the functions you see there. When you’re ready, type the contracts, purpose statements, examples and definitions into the Definitions Area.
- Use the `.build-column` method to add a new column to the animals table, showing the weight of every animal in kilograms.

== Introducing Histograms (Time 20 minutes)

=== Overview
Students look at a bar chart and a histogram, compare/contrast them, and make observations about what they have in common and how they are different. Then they learn a more formal explanation of histograms.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students complete @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/summarizing-columns.adoc}.

The display on the left side of @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/summarizing-columns.adoc} is a @vocab{Bar chart}. 

- Bar charts use the horizontal axis to show values of a categorical variable (in the diagram on the right, `species`). 
- The vertical axis here shows @vocab{frequency} of categorical values in the dataset.
- This bar chart happens to show the categorical values in alphabetical order from left to right, but it would be  fine to re-order them any way we wish. The bar for “dogs” could have been drawn before the one for “cats”, without changing the meaning of the display. _It never makes sense to talk about the “shape” of a categorical data set_, since that shape holds no meaning.

The display on the right side is called a @vocab{histogram}. 

- Histograms show the distribution of _quantitative_ data. 
- Since quantitative data can be ordered from smallest-to-largest, these bars _cannot_ be re-ordered.
- Histograms allow us to see the shape of a data set.

Animal shelters make decisions about food, capacity and policies based on how long it takes for animals to be adopted. But looking at each value in the weeks column is tedious, and isn’t always the easiest way to make sense of the data. As the saying goes, sometimes you “can’t see the forest for the trees”. Summarizing with a single number (like the average or the max) also leaves out a lot of important information. So instead of talking about each individual in a dataset, or simply reporting the average for all those individuals, Data Scientists find it useful to describe the overall *shape* of the data.

=== Student-Facing Task Assessment

A display of how long it takes animals to get adopted can make it easier to get an idea of what adoption times were most common, and if there were any unusually long or short times that it took for an animal to be adopted. Type the following into the interactions area:

----
histogram(animals-table, "weeks", 5)
----

Display this histogram for students to see.

[.lesson-instruction]
Look at the histogram and count how many animals took between 0 and 5 weeks to be adopted. How many took between 5 and 10 weeks? What else do you Notice? What do you Wonder?


Some observations you can share with the class, to get them started:

- We see most of the histogram’s area under the two bars between 0 and 10 weeks, so we can say it was most common for an animal to be adopted in 10 weeks or less. 
- We see a small amount of the histogram’s area trailing out to unusually high values, so we can say that a couple of animals took an unusually long time to be adopted: one took even more than 30 weeks.
- More than half of the animals (17 out of 31) took just 5 weeks or less to be adopted. But those few unusually long adoption times pulled the average up to 5.8 weeks. 

If someone would ask what was typical for the adoption times, one could say: “Almost all of the animals were adopted in 10 weeks or less, but a couple of animals took an unusually long time to be adopted -- even more than 20 or 30 weeks!” Without looking at the histogram’s shape, we could not have drawn this conclusion.

[.lesson-instruction]
What would the histogram look like if most of the animals took more than 20 weeks to be adopted, but a couple of them were adopted in fewer than 5 weeks?

=== Collect

Histograms are a powerful way to display a data set and assess its @vocab{shape}. But shape is just one of three key aspects that tell us what’s going on with a quantitative data set. In the next unit, we’ll explore the other two: center and spread.
