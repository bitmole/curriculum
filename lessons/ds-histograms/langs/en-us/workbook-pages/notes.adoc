= Histograms

*Bar charts* show the number of rows belonging to a given category. The more rows in each category, the longer the bar.

-  _Bar charts provide a visual representation of the frequency of values in a  *categorical* column._

- There’s no strict numerical way to order these bars, but *sometimes there’s an order* that makes sense. For example, bars for the number of orders for different t-Shirt sizes might be presented in order of smallest to largest shirt.

*Histograms* show the number of rows that fall within certain intervals, or “bins” on a horizontal axis. The more rows that that fall within a particular “bin”, the taller the bar.

- _Histograms provide a visual representation of the frequencies of values in a *quantitative* column._

- Quantitative data *can always be ordered*, so the bars of a histogram always progress from smallest (on the left) to largest (on the right).

- When dealing with histograms, it’s important to select a good  *bin size*. If the bins are too small or too large, it is difficult to see the shape of the dataset.
