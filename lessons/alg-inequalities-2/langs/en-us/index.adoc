== Compound Inequalities @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students consider the need to _compose_ inequalities, and think about how to write them.

=== Launch

We use inequalities for lots of things:

- Is it hot out? (@math{temperature \gt 80°})
- Did I get paid enough for painting that fence? (@math{temperature \lt $100})
- Are the cookies finished baking? (@math{timer = 0})

Have students come up with other examples.

But many times we need to _combine_ inequalities:

- Should I go to the beach? (@math{temperature \gt 80°} and @math{weather = "sunny"})
- Was this burrito worth the price? (@math{taste = "delicious"} and @math{price \leq $20})

Have students come up with other examples.

Guide students through other examples of `and` and `or` with various statements, such as "I'm wearing a red shirt AND I'm a math teacher, true or false?" or "I'm an NBA basketball star OR I'm having pizza for lunch, true or false?". This can make for a good sit-down, stand-up activity, where students take turns saying compound boolean statements and everyone stands if that statement is true for them.

=== Investigate
Both mathematics and programming have ways of combining - or _composing_ - inequalities.

Have students complete @workbook-link{pages/and-or.adoc}.

=== Synthesize
- Be really careful to check for understanding here. __Expresions using `and` only produce `true` if both of their sub-expressions are `true`. Expressions using `or` produce `true` if *either* of their sub-expressions are `true`.__

@span{.title}{Strategies for English Language Learners}

When describing compound inequalities, be careful not to use "english shortcuts". For example, we might say "I am holding a marker _and_ an eraser" instead of "I am holding a marker _and_ I am holding an eraser." These sentences mean the same thing, but the first one obscures the fact that "and" joins two complete phrases. For ELL/ESL students, this is unecessarily adds to cognitive load!

== Exploring Compuound Inequalities

=== Launch
Have students identify 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions for each of the following inequalities and think discuss what they're graphs would look like.

* x > 5 
* x < 15 

What about the solution set of x > 5 `and` x < 15?  What numbers make both of these inequality expressions true?
How would that be different from x > 5 `or` x < 15?  What numbers make at least one of these inequality expressions true?

=== Investigate

Have students log in to the

@ifproglang{pyret}{@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1ErJCa-wrr4zdV5U4lhUhIXvcup8R6_5y&v=8c4da7d, Compound Inequalities Starter File} 
}
read the carefully and click run to see the graphs they've just considered.

- Turn to the Explore the five functions in this starter file.  They all produce @vocab{booleans}. Through your exploration, see if you can come up with an explanation of what a @vocab{boolean} is.
 
[.lesson-point]
 A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Number, or Image, but unlike the others there are only two values: `true` and `false`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @exercise-link{pages/pyret/boolean-functions.adoc} and use the starter file to complete the questions, identifying inputs that will make each function _true_ and inputs that will make each function _false_.

- Additional practice with Booleans can be found at @link{../ds-pyret-intro/pages/booleans.shtml}

=== Synthesize
- Students will see functions on the worksheet that they've never encountered before! But instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about what they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.
