| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* Role-playing can help students understand the job of `onscreen`?, and how it relates to `safe-left?` and `safe-right?`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* Role-playing can help students understand the job of `is-onscreen`, and how it relates to `is-safe-left` and `is-safe-right`.
endif::[]
* If a student's `TARGET` and `DANGER` image seem to be "getting stuck" on the edge of the screen, the student may have to adjust the side boundaries depending on the size of their images.
* The code for the boundary functions in the game is _exactly the same_ as in Sam the Butterfly.

- To visually demonstrate why `onscreen?` isn't preventing Sam from going off the right side, have students act it out!  The student who plays `onscreen?` will only ask the student playing `safe-left?` if Sam is safe, ignoring `safe-right?` at this point.  Have students watching discuss and explain what is happening and brainstorm how to fix `onscreen?`.* +

Students use what they've learned to fix the `onscreen?` function and should now see that Sam cannot move off of the left or right sides of the screen.

What if we wanted to keep Sam safe on the top and bottom edges of the screen as well?  What additional functions would we need?  What functions would need to change?

== Applying to the Game @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students identify common patterns between 2-dimensional boundary detection and detecting whether a player is onscreen. They apply the same problem-solving and narrow mathematical concept from the previous lesson to a more general problem.

=== Launch

Have students open their in-progress game file and press Run.  

- How are the `TARGET` and `DANGER` behaving right now? +
_They move across the screen._

- What do we want to change? +
_We want them to come back after they leave one side of the screen._

- How do we know when an image has moved off the screen? +
_We can see it._

- How can we make the computer understand when an image has moved off the screen? +
_We can teach the computer to compare the image's @vocab{coordinates} to a numeric boundary, just like we did with Sam the Butterfly!_

=== Investigate

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Students apply what they learned from Sam the Butterly to fix the `safe-left?`, `safe-right?`, and `onscreen?` functions in their own code.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Students apply what they learned from Sam the Butterly to fix the `is-safe-left`, `is-safe-right`, and `is-onscreen` functions in their own code.
endif::[]  
Since the screen dimensions for their game are 640x480, just like Sam, they can use their code from Sam as a starting point.

Students will need to test their code with their images to see if the boundaries are correct for them.  Students with large images may need to use slightly wider boundaries, or vice versa for small images.  In some cases, students may have to go back and rescale their images if they are too large or too small for the game.
