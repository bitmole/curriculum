= Compound Inequality Functions

Each of the plots below was generated using the code `inequality(comp-ineq, [list: -1, 0, 1.6, 3, 5.2, 7, 8.1, 9] )`.  With the exception of the example, each plot below was defined using the numbers 3 and 7. Write the code for how `comp-ineq` was defined for each plot in the space provided. 

[cols="^.^1,20,^.^20"]
