| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Understand how the conjunctions `and` and `or` differ

* Describe the solution set of a @vocab{compound inequality}

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain the difference between how `and` and `or` are used in programming
* I can use two or more inequalities together and describe the area they enclose
//* I can tell someone else how two or more @vocab{function}s work together

== Introducing Compound Inequalities

=== Overview
Students consider the need to _compose_ inequalities, and think about how to write them.

=== Launch

We use inequalities for lots of things:

- Is it hot out? (@math{temperature \gt 80°})
- Did I get paid enough for painting that fence? (@math{paid \ge $100})
- Are the cookies finished baking? (@math{timer = 0})

[.lesson-instruction]
What other examples can you come up with?

Many times we need to _combine_ inequalities:

- Should I go to the beach? (@math{temperature \gt 80°} and @math{weather = "sunny"})
- Was this burrito worth the price? (@math{taste = "delicious"} and @math{price \leq $15})

[.lesson-instruction]
Can you think of examples of when we might want to combine inequalities?

Guide students through other examples of `and` and `or` with various statements, such as "I'm wearing a red shirt AND I'm a math teacher, true or false?" or "I'm an NBA basketball star OR I'm having pizza for lunch, true or false?" This can make for a good sit-down, stand-up activity, where students take turns saying compound boolean statements and everyone stands if that statement is true for them.

=== Investigate
Both mathematics and programming have ways of combining - or _composing_ - inequalities.

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete @printable-exercise{pages/boolean-coe-to-code1.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/and-or.adoc}.

=== Synthesize
Be really careful to check for understanding here.

- Expressions using `and` only produce `true` if both of their sub-expressions are `true`.
- Expressions using `or` produce `true` if *either* of their sub-expressions are `true`.

@span{.title}{Strategies for English Language Learners}

When describing compound inequalities, be careful not to use "english shortcuts". For example, we might say "I am holding a marker _and_ an eraser" instead of "I am holding a marker _and_ I am holding an eraser." These sentences mean the same thing, but the first one obscures the fact that "and" joins two complete phrases. For ELL/ESL students, this is unecessarily adds to cognitive load!

== Solutions and Non-Solutions of Compound Inequalities

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- What are 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions for @math{x \gt 5} ?
** _Possible answers: 5.001, 1000, 24, 73.26_
- What are 4 solutions and 4 non-solutions for @math{x \le 15}?
** _Possible answers: 15, 14.98, -63, 1/2_
- What numbers make _both_ of these inequalities true?
** _Possible answers: 5.001, 10, 12.374, 15_
- What is the solution set for @math{x \gt 5} `and` @math{x \le 15}?
** @math{5 \lt x \le 15}
- How would that be different from @math{x \gt 5} `or` @math{x \le 15}?
** _All real numbers are a part of the solution set for @math{x \gt 5} `or` @math{x \le 15}_

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
- Log in to the @starter-file{inequalities-compound}.
- Click "Run" to see the two graphs you've just considered, @math{x \gt 5} and @math{x \le 15}.

When students click "Run", four graphs will appear. The top two are the inequalities they've just discussed. Encourage students to verify that their solutions and non-solutions are correct. Explain that the bottom two graphs are produced by the special functions `and-intersection` and `or-union`. Use the discussion questions below as a jumping off point in guiding students' analysis of the starter file.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Can you describe what `and-intersection` does?
** _It takes in two functions and a list of numbers and produces a graph with the points and the shaded @vocab{intersection} of values that make both of the inequalities true._
- What do you think will happen if we enter a pair of inequalities that does not intersect at all and therefore has no solutions?
** _We will see a graph with only red circles, representing non-solutions, as below. None of the graph will be shaded blue. A message will tell us that no solutions exist in the provided range._

- Can you describe what `or-union` does?
** _It takes in two functions and a list of numbers and produces a graph with the points and the shaded @vocab{union} of values that make either or both of the inequalities true._
- What do you think will happen if the union of a pair of inequalities includes _all_ real numbers?
** _We will see a graph that has all regions shaded blue, with only green circles (no red). A message will tell us that all regions shaded blue are a part of the solution._

Once students are familiar with the starter file, they are ready use it as they to practice identifying solutions and non-solutions for compound inequalities.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{compound-inequality-solutions.adoc}.
- Explore the compound inequalities listed using the @starter-file{inequalities-compound}, identifying solutions and non-solutions for each.

Explain to students that instead of defining two functions as simple inequalities, we can produce an inequality graph by defining one function to be a @vocab{compound inequality}! In the following activity, students will analyze inequality graphs and define a _single_ function that produces the graph. Walk students through the completed first example before they attempt to write this code on their own.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{compound-inequality-functions.adoc}.
- Write code to describe the compound inequalities pictured.

@ifproglang{pyret}{If you have time, have students open to @online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/5fdf8618945cb549d457fb85, Matching Compound Inequality Functions and plots}
}
=== Synthesize
- How did the graphs of intersections and unions differ?
