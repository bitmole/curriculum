= Compound Inequalities: Solutions & Non-Solutions

For each Compound Inequality listed below, identify 4 _solutions_ and 4 _non-solutions_.  _If there are *no solutions* or the solution set includes *all real numbers* you can write that instead of making a list._

* Solutions for @vocab{intersections}, which use *and* will make both of the expressions `true`.

* Solutions for @vocab{unions}, which use *or* will make at least one of the expressions `true`.

The most critical numbers to understand are the ones used to define the expressions. Make sure to decide whether each of these is a solution or non-solution.

Could there ever be a union with _no solutions_? Explain your thinking.

@vspace{1ex}

_No. The solution set for each inequality includes a subset of the real numbers and the union of two inequalities will include more than the numbers in either of those subsets._

@vspace{2ex}

Could there ever be an intersection whose solution is _all real numbers_? Explain your thinking.

@vspace{1ex}

_No. The solution set for each inequality includes a subset of the real numbers, so the list of numbers where the subsets overlap couldn't possibly include all of the real numbers._
