= Compound Inequality Functions

Each of the plots below was generated using the code `(inequality comp-ineq (list -1 0 1.6 3 5.2 7 8.1 9))`.  Write the code for how `comp-ineq` was defined for each plot in the space provided. The first one was done for you. 

[cols="^.^1,20,^.^20"]

| Ex| @centered-image{../images/comp-ineq0.png}	| `(define (comp-ineq x)(and (> x 0) (<= x 8.1)))`
| 1| @centered-image{../images/comp-ineq2.png}	| `(define (comp-ineq x)(and (> x 3) (< x 7)))`
| 2| @centered-image{../images/comp-ineq3.png}	| `(define (comp-ineq x)(or (> x 3) (< x 7)))`
| 3| @centered-image{../images/comp-ineq4.png}	| `(define (comp-ineq x)(or (< x 3) (>= x 7)))`
| 4| @centered-image{../images/comp-ineq1.png}	| `(define (comp-ineq x)(and (< x 3) (> x 7)))`
