|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Explain what a piecewise function is
* Give examples of inputs and outputs of a given piecewise function

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can describe how piecewise functions work.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The Design Recipe looks a bit different for piecewise, or conditional, functions.  Ensure students are taking time to write examples and circle what is changing.
* 

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
