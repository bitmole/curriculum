== Correlations and Predictions (Time 40 minutes)

[.lesson-point]
Correlations have direction.

- A _positive correlation_ means that the variable on the y-axis
  increases as the variable on the x-axis goes up. For example,
  “the older the animal, the more weeks it generally takes to get
  adopted”.

- A _negative correlation_ means that the variable on the y-axis
  decreases as the variable on the x-axis goes down. For example,
  “the longer an animal is at the shelter, the less they
  generally weigh”. 

Do you see a correlation in the pounds-vs-weeks scatter plot? If
so, is it positive or negative? What correlations, if any, did
you see in the other scatterplots you created?

You’ve already learned three ways to find the “center” of a
dataset in one dimension: the mean, the median and the mode all
represent a way to collapse a bunch of points on a number line
into a single, summary number. If the “center” of points on a
number line is a single point, what is the “center” of points in
a _two-dimensional_ cloud, which cluster around a line?

What we need to do is find a _line_ -- called a @vocab{line of
best fit}, or a “regression line” -- that is at the center of
this cloud. Each point exerts a little bit of “pull” on the line,
with points above the line yanking it up and points below the
line dragging it down. Points that are really far away -- our
@vocab{outliers} and our influential observations -- pull the
line harder than those that are close to the line. The slope of
the line will be positive or negative depending on whether or not
the correlation is positive or negative. Given a value on the
x-axis, this line allows us to “predict” what the corresponding
value on the y-axis might be. This allows us to make inferences
about a population, based on a sample of that population.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/drawing-predictors.adoc},
and do your best to draw a @vocab{line of best fit} through each of the
scatter plots on the left.

[.lesson-point]
Correlations have _strength_.

- If the cloud is tightly packed, there is a _strong correlation_.
- If the cloud is loosely scattered, there is a _weak correlation_.
- If the points are all over the place, with no tendency to rise
  or fall from left to right, there may be _no correlation_. 

[.lesson-instruction]
For each line you drew on
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/drawing-predictors.adoc},
determine the direction and strength of the correlation by
circling the words that describe it.

[.lesson-point]
Correlation does NOT imply causation.

If two quantities are _correlated_, it doesn’t mean that one _causes_
the other! For example, a study found that there is a strong
correlation between the number of people who become tangled in
their own bedsheets each year is correlated with the amount of
cheese consumed that year. It happens that both of those values
have been increasing over the past decade, but there is no causal
relationship between them!

What correlations do you think there are in your dataset? Would
you like to investigate a subset of your data to find those
correlations?

[.lesson-instruction]
Brainstorm a few possible correlations that you might expect to
find in your dataset, and make some scatter plots to investigate.

Have students share back their correlations, and why they expect
to find them.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/correlations-in-my-dataset.adoc},
and list three correlations you’d like to search
for.

== Closing (Time 10 minutes)

After looking at the scatter plot for our animal shelter, do you
still agree with the claim on
@worksheet-link{ds-correlations/workbook-pages/disproving-claim.adoc}? Perhaps
you need more information, or to see the analysis broken down
separately by animal.

You’ve started to look for correlations in your dataset, and now
you know how to create scatter plots to visualize them. But how
do we know if a correlation is strong enough to be useful?
Eyeballing charts isn’t good enough! In the next Unit, you’ll
learn how to calculate a correlation, and get a feel for strength
of a relationship based on a single number. You’ll investigate
the correlations in your research that you mapped out here.
