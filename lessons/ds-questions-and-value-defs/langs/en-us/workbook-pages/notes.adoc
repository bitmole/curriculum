*Answering Questions from Data* can take many forms. Here are a few types of questions, each requiring a different kind of analysis:

- *Lookup Questions* can be answered just by finding the right row and column a table. (E.g., “How old is Toggle?”)

- *Compute Questions* can be answered by computing over a single row or column. (E.g., “What is the heaviest animal at the shelter?”)

- *Relate Questions* require looking for trends across multiple rows or columns. (E.g.,  “Do cats tend to be adopted sooner than dogs?”)

In Pyret, we can *define values* by giving them names that we can refer to later on. For example, we might say `name = "Maya"` or `sticker = star(20, "solid", "yellow")`, so that we can use `name` and `sticker` in our code.
