= Composing Image Functions

You’ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

@include{fragments/image-function-contracts.adoc}

1) Make an image of your name, in big purple letters. Draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the code that will create this image.

@vspace{20ex}

Try using the `scale` function to make your name bigger or smaller. Draw the Circle of Evaluation (hint: use what you wrote above!), then write the code.

@vspace{20ex}

In your own words, what does scale do?

@span{.blankline}{}
@span{.blankline}{}

@vspace{20ex}

Try out `rotate`, `flip-horizontal`, and `flip-vertical`. Use the space below to write your
code, then test out your code in WeScheme when you’re ready.
