= Order of Operations (Circles of Evaluation)

@lesson-description{Students learn to model arithmetic expressions with the visual tool for order of operations and function composition known as Circles of Evaluation.}

[.left-header, cols="20a, 80a", stripes=none]
|===
| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Model an arithmetic expression using Circles of Evaluation.
* Translate Circles of Evaluation into code.

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can write Circles of Evaluation for a given arithmetic expression.
* I can translate a Circle of Evaluation model into code.
* I can use numbers and operations in a programming environment.

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Error messages are the computer trying to give us a clue that something is wrong.  Model reacting to error messages with interest to demonstrate to students that the messages are a helpful tool.


* After the first few exercises in creating Circles of Evaluation, ask students whether they create them from the 'inside-out' (drawing the inner circles first) or from the 'outside-in.'  After they've given their responses, have them try using the OTHER way!


* Up until now, we didn't have a visual spatial model for explaining the order of operations. Ask students to compare Circles of Evaluation to previous methods they've learned (PEMDAS, GEMAS, etc)

* If a student doesn't know where to start, encourage them to start with what they know


* For a memory hook, model the "bug that crawls through the circle" explanation.   


* Students may benefit from using multiple colors to distinguish between the different smaller expressions and parentheses.


|Prerequisites
|
* Students should have knowledge of general arithmetic and the order of operations.

== Get Ready: 

Students should be logged into 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme}.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org}.
endif::[]


== Launch: (8 mins)
Option 1: Watch the @link{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9h1oqv21Vs, PEMDAS is wrong} video with students then ask students what they thought of the video and what they think/know of PEMDAS.
 (Suggestion: watch the video at 0.5 speed because they talk really fast).  

Option 2: Have students evaluate the expression in the image below and gather a few responses from the students.  Discuss some of the issues mentioned in this Slate article, @link{https://slate.com/technology/2013/03/facebook-math-problem-why-pemdas-doesnt-always-give-a-clear-answer.html, What Is the Answer to That Math Problem on Facebook?}.

== Explore: (5 mins) Let There Be Numbers!
Have students explore numbers in the Interactions window.  Make sure both students take a turn at the keyboard.
[.notice-box]
.Notice & Wonder
**** 
In pairs, students will each try entering a variety of numbers, then together they will write down what they notice and what they wonder.
****


== Discuss: (10 mins)
* What type of numbers did you try?
* What did you notice? What did you wonder?
* Did anyone try any irrational numbers? (For example: pi, e)
* Did you get any error messages?
* Did anyone try to add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers? 
* What was the error message? 
* How can we add, subtract, multiply, or divide in our coding environment?

=== Direct Instruction:
At this point, you may provide some direct instruction on Circles of Evaluation & Contracts, such as how to:

* Create a Circle of Evaluation from an expression.
* Convert a Circle of Evaluation into code.
* Write the Contract of a function (Name, Domain, & Range).
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* Write the 6 contracts for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, and `sqrt` into the Contracts page.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* Write the 6 contracts for `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `num-sqr`, and `num-sqrt` into the Contracts page.
endif::[]

== Practice: (10 mins)
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
* Have students practice creating Circles of Evaluation using the 6 functions(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, `sqrt`).
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
* Have students practice creating Circles of Evaluation using the 6 functions(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `num-sqr`, `num-sqrt`).
endif::[]

* Do spaces matter when typing in functions?
* Does the order of the numbers matter in the functions? Which functions?
* What do the error messages tell us? 
* What connections do you see between the expression, circle, and code?

== Practice: (10 mins)  Practice
Have students practice moving between Circles of Evaluation and code with a station review.


* Convert the expression into a Circle of Evaluation.
* Convert the Circle of Evaluation model into code.


Once the students feel confident in their work, they can enter the code into their coding environment to test it out.


== Create/Apply: (15 mins) 

Students will create a Circle of Evaluation based on an expression theyâ€™ve created using at least 4 of the 6 functions:
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, `sqrt`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `num-sqr`, `num-sqrt`.
endif::[]

Using @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/OrderOfOperations1-FrayerModelTemplate.pdf, this Frayer Model}, create the code that represents this circle, translate this into code, evaluate the expression using the order of operations, and then compare and contrast the three methods.
