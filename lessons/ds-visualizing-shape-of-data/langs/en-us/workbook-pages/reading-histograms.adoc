= Reading Histograms

Students watched 5 videos, and rated them on a scale of 1 to 10.
While the *average score* for every video is the same (5.5), the
*shapes* of the ratings distributions were very different! Match
the summary description (left) with the histogram of student
ratings (right). For each histogram, *the x-axis is the score,
and the y-axis is the number of students who gave it that score*.
