*A.* 2 is less than 5, and 0 is equal to 6

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===

| `((2 < 5) and (0 == 6))`

| @show{(sexp->coe '(and (< 2 5) (= 0 6)))}

*B.* 6 is greater than 8, or -4 is less than 1

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===

| `((6 > 8) or (-4 < 1))`

| @show{(sexp->coe '(or (> 6 8) (< -4 1)))}


|===



*C.* The String “purple” is the same as the String “purple”, and 3 plus 5 equals 8

[cols="1a,1a"]
|===

| `(string-equal("purple", "purple") and ((3 + 5) == 8))`

| @show{(sexp->coe '(and (string-equal "purple" "purple") (= (+ 3
5) 8)))}
