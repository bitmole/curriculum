| Key Points for the Facilitator
|* A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Number, or Image, but, unlike the others, there are only two values: `true` and `false`. While simple to explain, this different behavior can be confusing for some students.
* Functions that produce Booleans are typically questions, so the names of the functions in this lesson read like questions. 
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
* For example, `odd?`, `even?` are both functions that are asking if a condition, such as a number being odd or even, is true or false.
* Role-playing can help students understand the jobs of `odd?` and `even?`. }

@ifproglang{pyret}{
* For example, `is-odd`, `is-even` are both functions that are asking if a condition, such as a number being odd, is true or false.

== Introducing Booleans

=== Launch
Students should be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }

Ask students to evaluate Circles of Evaluation for simple expressions they've seen before, and ask them to convert them into code.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(+ 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(- 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(* 8 0))}

Then show them unfamiliar Circles of Evaluation, and ask them to hypothesize what they think they mean, what they will evaluate to, and what the code would look like.

- @show{(sexp->coe '(> 1 2))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(< 4 5))}
- @show{(sexp->coe '(= 8 0))}

Have students convert these Circles to code and type them in. What did they evaluate to? What do they think the outputs mean?

Values like `true` and `false` obviously aren't Numbers or Images. But they also aren't Strings, or else they would have quotes around them. We've found a __new datatype__, called a @vocab{Boolean}. 

=== Investigate

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
Have students log in to the @link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=jvWT8h7pLc, Boolean Starter File} and open to  @exercise-link{pages/wescheme/boolean-functions.adoc, Boolean Functions.} 
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{

Have students log in to the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1qoAI2cFSeM7HIrR5L6LzOAX9DlXu9Le1&v=8c4da7d, Boolean Starter File} and open to @exercise-link{pages/pyret/boolean-functions.adoc, Boolean Functions.} 
}

[.lesson-instruction]
- Explore the five functions in this starter file.  They all produce @vocab{booleans}. Through your exploration, see if you can come up with an explanation of what a @vocab{boolean} is.
 
[.lesson-point]
A @vocab{Boolean} is just another @vocab{data type}, like Number, or Image, but unlike the others there are only two values: `true` and `false`.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @exercise-link{pages/pyret/boolean-functions.adoc} and use the starter file to complete the questions, identifying inputs that will make each function _true_ and inputs that will make each function _false_.

- Additional practice with Booleans can be found at @link{../ds-pyret-intro/langs/en-us/pages/booleans.shtml}

=== Synthesize
- Students will see functions on the worksheet that they've never encountered before! But instead of answering their questions, encourage them to make a _guess_ about what they do, and then type it in to discover for themselves.
- Explicitly point out that _everything they know still works!_ They can use their reasoning about Circles of Evaluation and Contracts to figure things out.

=== Common Misconceptions
- Many students - especially traditionally high-achieving ones - will be very concerned about writing examples that are "wrong." The misconception here is that an expression that produces `false` is somehow _incorrect_. You can preempt this in advance, by explaining that our Boolean-producing functions _should sometimes return false_.

== Introducing Inequalities @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover (or expand their understanding of) inequalities by identifying solutions and non-solutions and connecting expressions to graphic representations.

=== Launch

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
Have students open the @link{https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=eVMjb9omtP, Simple Inequalities Starter File.} 
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Have students open the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=11BYRF8HhPyrAuPOttTxDDHoBhCnUyEmI&v=8c4da7d, Simple Inequalities Starter File.} 
}

Students should read the example code in the file carefully and click run to see the image it returns.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
Have students open to the @exercise-link{pages/pyret/simple-inequalities.adoc, Simple Inequalities worksheet} and complete it with a partner, identifying solutions and non-solutions to each inequality and testing them in the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=11BYRF8HhPyrAuPOttTxDDHoBhCnUyEmI&v=8c4da7d, Simple Inequalities Starter File.}

=== Synthesize
- What patterns did you observe in how the inequalities worked?
