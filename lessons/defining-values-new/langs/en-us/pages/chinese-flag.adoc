@n This file uses a function we havenâ€™t seen before! What is it? @fitb{15em}{@show{(if *solutions-mode?* "_put-image_" "")}}

@n What is its contract? @fitb{30em}{@show{(if *solutions-mode?* "_put-image :: Image, Number, Number, Image -> Image_" "")}}

@n Highlight or circle the structure you see repeated in the code over and over again.(_Hint: it's code that makes a shape._)

@n Define a value that could be used to simplify the code.

@span{.blankline}{@show{(if *solutions-mode?* (sexp->code '(define yellow-star (star 15 "solid" "yellow"))) "")}}

@n Open the @ifproglang{wescheme}{
@online-exercise{https://www.wescheme.org/open/editor?publicId=Gc01ngfMN0, Chinese flag starter file.}
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
@online-exercise{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1qUY9u9j_NfZM8PJwT9QKJKNlD3RPbSDE, Chinese flag starter file}
}
and click run. Then type @show{(sexp->code 'china)} into the interactions area and click *Enter*

@n What value is @show{(sexp->code 'china)} defined as? @fitb{30em}{ @show{(if *solutions-mode?* "_the composed image of the Chinese flag_" "")}}

@n Save a copy of the file and clean up the code using the value you defined. Click run and confirm that the new file builds the same image as the original.

@n Now change the color of all of the stars to black in both files. Then change the size of the stars.

@n Why is it helpful to define values for repeated images?
