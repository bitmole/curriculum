| 1
| Mrs. Burke's cell phone has a 6-character password, made up only of numbers. Her son is trying to unlock it to play a game. How many possible passwords does he have to guess?
| *YES*  {nbsp}  No
| @math{permute\mbox{-}w\mbox{-}replace(10, 6) = 10^{6} = 1,000,000}

| The dentist has 8 different stickers to give away to the next patients A through H. How many different ways could she give them out?
| Yes  {nbsp}  *NO*
| @math{permute\mbox{-}no\mbox{-}replace(8, 8) = \frac{8!}{(8 - 8)!}}

@math{8! \div 1 = 40,320}

| Eric Allatta is the head chef at the top restaurant in Santa Fe. His speciality is four-color enchilada platter, with each enchilada covered in a different-colored sauce. If he has six colors to choose from, how many unique plates can he make?
| Yes  {nbsp}  *NO*
| @math{permute\mbox{-}no\mbox{-}replace(6, 4) = \frac{6!}{(6 - 4)!}}

@math{\frac{6!}{2!} = 360}

| A magician opens a fresh deck of 52 cards, and asks an audience member to pick six of them. He says he'll guess all six - in order. What are the chances he'll guess them correctly?
| Yes  {nbsp}  *NO*
| @math{permute\mbox{-}no\mbox{-}replace(52, 6) = \frac{52!}{(52 - 6)!}}

@math{\frac{52!}{46!} = 14,658,134,400}

His chances are one in nearly 15 million! That's a heck of a trick!

| Emma is knitting a hat, and can each stripe can be a different color. She has three different colors of yarn to choose from, and the hat has 8 stripes. How many different designs could she make?
| *YES* {nbsp}   No
| @math{permute\mbox{-}w\mbox{-}replace(3, 8) = 3^{8} = 6,561}
