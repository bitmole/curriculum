| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Test whether or not a graph is a function using the vertical line test.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can identify which graphs are functions and which aren't using the vertical line test.

== Do Now:
Give each student a small piece of graph paper or a post-it. Have them draw a rectangle and hang it on the board in the front of the room.

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- Look at this beautiful collection of rectangles! How did you know how to make such a beautiful collection of rectangles?! _All rectangles have 4 sides and 4 right angles._
- We can also make beautiful rectangles in the programming environment, but @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret} @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme} couldn't have made this collection with my instructions. Why not?

_We are flexible humans and made game-time decisions about size, color, ratio of length to width, and whether or not to color the rectangles in. Machines need to be given the specific set of inputs that they are programmed to expect and use those inputs to make exactly what they've been programmed to make. The Domain for `rectangle` in @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret} @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme}? is Number, Number, String, String and if we don't give `rectangle` the arguments to satisfy its Domain we get an error message!_
--

=== Extension:

[.lesson-instruction]
--
- We could figure out how to make all of these rectangles in  using the `rectangle` function.
- What new functions could we define that would save us time if wanted to make the collection of images you've made by hand in @ifproglang{pyret}{Pyret} @ifproglang{wescheme}{WeScheme}?

_This will depend on what students produced, but, for example:_
* _If some are solid and some are outline we might define `solid-rectangle` and ``outline-rectangle``_
* _If there a few predominant colors we might define `red-rectangle`, `blue-rectangle`, etc._
* _If there are several 3x5 rectangles we might define ``rectangle-3-5``_

@ifproglang{pyret}{`3 arguments were passed to the operator. The operator evaluated to a function accepting 4 parameters. An application expression expects the number of parameters and arguments to be the same.`}
@ifproglang{wescheme}{`rectangle: expects 4 arguments, but given 3`}

[.lesson-instruction]

- Do any of the rectangles that you see hanging on the board have enough in common that we could define a function like `gt` to make them?

Functions are labor-saving devices that allow humans to give machines instructions about the work we want them to do for us, but they are only as good as the directions we give them!

For example, a vending machine that's programmed to release a granola bar when the granola bar button is pushed and the corresponding amount of money is supplied, can't decide what snack you want when you're too hungry to make the decision for yourself.

If we turn on cruise control at 60mph, the car will keep driving at 60mph, more consistently than a human could, no matter what happens. But, a safe human driver will slow down as they approach a curve or see brake lights up ahead, and a car that's been instructed to drive at 60mph will keep doing just that until a human tells it to stop.

=== Investigate

We can test a graph to see whether or not it's a function by imagining a series of vertical lines. If there is any vertical line that can be drawn that would intersect more than one point on the graph, the graph is not a function.

[.lesson-instruction]
Draw a rectangle.

== Functions Can Be Discrete or Continuous @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch

Some functions look like a lines, vs, and curves. These are continuous.

Others looks like a collection of dots. These are discrete.

Sometimes it makes sense to connect the dots and sometimes it doesn't. half a nickel, half a person, degrees

For example.

== Function of Notation

=== Overview

=== Launch
We've seen how functions like `gt` replace a variable in the function expression with the given value to produce an image.

@show{(sexp->code '(define (gt size)(triangle size "solid" "green")))}

[cols="2,3,1"]
|===
| Function Expression 				| What it Produces 											| Final Product
| @show{(sexp->code '(gt 10))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(triangle 10 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt10.png}
| @show{(sexp->code '(gt 20))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(triangle 20 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt20.png}
| @show{(sexp->code '(gt 30))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(triangle 30 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt30.png}
| @show{(sexp->code '(gt 40))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(triangle 40 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt40.png}
| @show{(sexp->code '(gt 50))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(triangle 50 "solid" "green"))} 		| @image{images/gt50.png}
|===

Function Notation in math works the same way. We replace the variable with the given value and then compute the value of the expression.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
@show{(sexp->code '(define (f x)(+ x 8)))}

[cols="2,3,1"]
|===
| Function Expression 				| What it Produces 						| Final Product
| @show{(sexp->code '(f 10))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(+ 10 8))} 		| 18
| @show{(sexp->code '(f 20))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(+ 20 8))} 		| 28
| @show{(sexp->code '(f 30))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(+ 30 8))} 		| 38
| @show{(sexp->code '(f 40))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(+ 40 8))} 		| 48
| @show{(sexp->code '(f 50))} 		| @show{(sexp->code '(+ 50 8))} 		| 58

}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{How do we want to format this for wescheme so that it looks as close to what it looks like in pyret as possible?}

=== Investigate

Have students turn to @printable-exercise{pages/match-examples-definitions-math.adoc}.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Start by looking at each table and highlighting what is changing from the first row to the following rows.
- Then, match each table to the function that defines it.

You may also want to have students complete @opt-online-exercise{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/60aa5c452505ed0802bfff38, Matching Examples & Function Definitions (Math)}

|@span{.title}{Connecting to Best Practices}
Writing examples and identifying the variables lays the groundwork for writing the function, which is especially important as the functions get more complex.  Don't skip this step!
