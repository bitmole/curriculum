| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Test whether or not a graph is a function using the vertical line test.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can identify which graphs are functions and which aren't using the vertical line test.

== Functions Have Exactly One Output for Each Input @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview

=== Launch
Functions are labor-saving devices that allow humans to give machines instructions about the work we want them to do for us. Whereas humans are flexible and can make game-time decisions about all sorts of things, machines need to be programmed to know what to do with whatever comes their way.

For example, a safe human driver will slow down as they approach a curve or see brake lights up ahead, but if a car's cruise control has been set at 60mph, a human will have to turn off the cruise control in order to slow down the vehicle when driving at 60mph isn't safe anymore.  Similarly, a vending machine can be programmed to release a granola bar if the granola bar button is pushed and the corresponding amount of money is supplied, but it can't decide which kind of snack we'd like to eat this afternoon.
