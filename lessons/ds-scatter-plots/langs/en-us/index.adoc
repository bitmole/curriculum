== Introduction (Time 15 minutes)

Why are some animals adopted quickly, while others take a long
time? What factors explain why one pet gets adopted right away,
and others wait months?

////
Ask the class for theories.
////

[.lesson-point]
Theory 1: Smaller animals get adopted faster because they’re
easier to care for.

How could we test that theory? Bar and pie charts are great for
showing us how the frequency of a categorical column. Histograms
and box plots are great for showing us the shape and distribution
of a quantitative column. But none of these displays will help us
see connections between two columns.

[.lesson-instruction]
Take a few minutes to look through the whole dataset, and see if
you agree with the statement. Could any of our visualizations or
measures of center help us answer this question? Write down your
hypothesis on
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/disproving-claim.adoc}, and how we
could use this dataset to see if you’re right.

////
Encourage students to discuss openly before writing.
////

We’ve got a lot of tools in our toolkit that help us think about an entire _column_ of a dataset:
- We have ways to find measures of center and spread for a given column.
- We have visualizations that let us see the shape of values in a
  quantitative column.
- We have visualizations that let us see the frequencies a
  categorical column.

What column is this question asking about?

////
Use this as an opportunity to review what these measures and
visualizations are. Redirect students back to their contracts
page! Point out that this question is asking about both pounds
and weeks.
////

This question is asking about _two columns_ in our dataset.
Specifically, it’s asking *if there is a relationship* between
pounds and weeks. Fortunately, there are other tools that let us
visualize a relationship between two quantitative columns!

////
If time allows, ask students how we might visualize this
relationship.
////

[.lesson-instruction]
Open your “Animals Starter File”. (If you do not have this file,
or if something has happened to it, you can always make a
@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1gaYAyYhvlKBm6VJuvJDcnoINBw76pL-L,
new copy}.)

For each animal in the shelter, there are two data points we care
about: how many `pounds` they weigh, and the number of `weeks` it
took to be adopted. We can use these points to plot each animal
as a point on the x- and y-axes. Eventually, we’ll have a whole
cloud of points, which show us the relationship between the two
columns for all the animals at the shelter.

[.lesson-instruction]
Complete
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/creating-scatterplot.adoc} in your
Student Workbook.

////
Suggestion: divide the full table up into sub-lists, and have a
few student plot 3-4 animals on the board. This can be done
collaboratively, resulting in a whole-class scatterplot!
////

== Scatter Plots (Time 30 minutes)

Here’s the contract for Pyret’s scatter-plot function, as well as
an example of a scatter plot that examines the relationship
between weight and adoption time. Notice that the contract is
written as a comment -- the `#` symbol means it’s just a note for
humans.  

----
# scatter-plot :: (t :: Table, labels :: String, xs :: String, ys :: String) -> Image
scatter-plot(animals-table, "name", "pounds", "weeks")
----


[.lesson-instruction]
Try making a few scatter plots, looking for relationships between columns in the animals-table.

[.lesson-point]
Theory 2: Younger animals get adopted faster because they are
cuter.

But cats, dogs, rabbits and tarantulas have very different
lifespans! A 5-lear-old tarantula is still really young, while a
5-year-old rabbit is fully grown. With differences like this, it
doesn’t make sense to put them all on the same scatter plot. To
do this analysis, we might have to make several displays, each
for a different subset.

@span{.right}{@image{images/visualizing-relationships-1.png, "",
400}}

Now that we have our scatter plot, what kind of patterns do we see?

[.lesson-instruction]
- Can you see a “cloud” around which the points are clustered?
- Are there places where the “cloud” is denser than others?
- Does the number of weeks to adoption seem to go up or down as the age increases?
- Are there any points that “stray from the pack”? Which ones? 

////
Suggestion: project the scatter plot at the front of the room,
and have students come up to the plot to point out their
patterns.
////

If we see a straight-line pattern in the cloud of scatter plot
points, this suggests the variables could be related in a certain
way. Do the two variables’ values tend to increase or decrease
together, or does one go down as the other goes up? We’d also
like to know if one variables tells us a lot or a little about
the other’s values. A single number called a @vocab{correlation} can
provide us with both pieces of information.

In this case, we’re looking for a correlation between `pounds` and
`weeks`. This relationship can be graphed as a line, which tries to
cut through the “middle” of the cloud. This line is called the
@vocab{line of best fit}, and it turns out to be really useful for making
predictions. For example, we can use the line to predict how long
a new dog would wait at the shelter, if the dog weighs 68 pounds.

Do you notice any data points that seem unusually far away from
the line? Which animals are those? These points are called
@vocab{outliers}, meaning that there is something special about them that
makes them different from everyone else.

[.lesson-instruction]
Why might these animals be outliers?

////
Give students a chance to come up with a few ideas, and share them with the class.
////

Outliers are always interesting:

- Sometimes they’re just random. Maybe Felix just met the right
  family early, or maybe we find out he lives nearby, got lost
  and his family came to get him. In that case, we might need to
  do some deep thinking about whether or not it’s appropriate to
  remove him from our dataset.

- Sometimes they can give you a deeper insight into your data.
  Maybe Felix is a special, popular breed of cat, and we discover
  that our dataset is missing an important column for breed!

- Sometimes outliers are the points we are looking for! What if
  we wanted to know which restaurants are a good value, and which
  are rip-offs? We could make a scatterplot of restaurant prices
  vs. reviews, an outlier that’s high above the rest of the
  points would be a restaurant whose reviews are _unusually good_
  for the price. An outlier way below the cloud would be a really
  bad deal.

[.lesson-instruction]
For practice, try making scatter plots for each of the following
relationships. If you see any outliers, try to explain them!
- The `age` of an animal vs the `pounds` of the animal
- The `legs` of an animal vs the number of `weeks` to be adopted
- The `age` vs the number of `legs` it has.

////
Debrief, showing the plots on the board. Make sure students see
plots for which there is no relationship, like the last one!
////

Of course, it might not make sense to group different animals
together in one plot! What if we wanted to see the relationship
between age and weeks for just the dogs in our database?

Try making scatter plots for that relate age to weeks, for each
of the subsets you’ve defined from the animals table. Does the
relationship appear stronger in some of the subsets than others?
Why?
