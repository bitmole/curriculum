= Visualizing Relationships

- *Scatter Plots* can be used to show a relationship between two quantitative
columns. Each row in the dataset is represented by a point, with one column
providing the x-value and the other providing the y-value. The resulting “point
cloud” makes it possible to look for a relationship between those two columns.
