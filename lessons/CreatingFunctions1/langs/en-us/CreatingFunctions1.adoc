|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain why a function is useful to someone else.
* I can plan and create my own function with examples.


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* This lesson represents a big shift in thinking.  After some practice, students will not be limited to pre-existing functions.
* Take plenty of time for the Design Recipe as students will return to it frequently.
