= Coordinates

@lesson-description{Students review the importance and need for coordinates in the context of a video game and brainstorm a game of their own.}

[@lesson-intro-table]

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Explain the need for @vocab{coordinates} in a given situation.
* Estimate coordinates in a bounded area.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can estimate the positions of objects using coordinates.
* I can collaborate with a partner to brainstorm a video game.
* I can create a sample mock-up (proof of concept) of my video game.

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs

| Supplemental Resources

* Coordinates (@link{https://quizizz.com/admin/quiz/5739e1b55752be78da03a648/coordinates, Quizizz})
* The Awesome Coordinate Plane Activity (@link{https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/563d705f36a7843710aba2ce, Desmos Activity})
* Submarine Coordinate Game (@link{https://www.geogebra.org/m/dyaxqKdP, Geogebra })
* Coordinate Grid Exploration (@link{https://t.co/2lIf5Yofmj, Geogebra })

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The launch activity should create and reinforce the need for coordinates and to attend to precision.
* Continue to use the same "Estimation" handout so students can track their pattern of estimation over time.

== Warmup

Students should be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }
and have their workbooks with a pen or pencil.

== Navigating a Grid @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are asked to come up with a way of identifying location on a grid, which provides the justification for coordinates.

=== Launch
Let's look at a game of "Hit or Miss." Have students Notice and Wonder about the Grid image below.

[.notice-box, cols="1", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@span{.title}{Notice and Wonder}
Ask students to write down what they Notice and Wonder about this game on @workbook-link{pages/NoticeAndWonder.adoc}.
|===

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- How would you describe where the "hits" are?
- How would you describe where the "misses" are?
- Where would you guess next to get a "hit"?

[.text-center]
Hit or Miss

@centered-image{images/HitOrMiss.png, Hit or Miss, 400, align="center"}

_As students discuss, let them reach the consensus themselves about the need for coordinates!_

=== Synthesize

- What can help us be more precise in playing "Hit or Miss"? _A system for describing exactly where we want to go, like coordinates!_
- How do you think this concept relates to a videogame? _Answers vary: we need to know where characters are on the screen, we need a way for players to interact with certain parts of the screen, etc_

== Bridging to Videogames @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore a coordinate activity in which a cartesian point is used to compute the position of a character in a game. From there, they brainstorm a game of their own.

=== Launch
In pairs, have students explore the @link{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pbm9nxr2rd, Ninja Cat Desmos graph}.

[.notice-box, cols="1", grid="none", stripes="none"]
|===
|
@span{.title}{Notice and Wonder}
As one partner explores the graph, the other student will write down what they Notice on @workbook-link{pages/NoticeAndWonder.adoc}.

As one partner explores the graph, the other student will write down what they Wonder.

To develop an intuition for coordinates, have students complete @workbook-link{pages/Estimation.adoc, Estimating Coordinates}. 

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
 - Students complete the @workbook-link{pages/BrainstormGame1.adoc, "Brainstorm Your Own Game"} worksheet and decide on a Player, Target, Danger, and Background for their game.
 - Students will use a @link{https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1ET8OazCiswbHrx8wyUAsSkcPRcsKC8xVoOJAc1YFKVE/copy, Google Draw template} (click "Make a copy" when prompted) to create a sample "screenshot" of their game by inserting images via Google Search.

Screenshot should include:

- Labeled estimates of coordinates for each character.
- 2 characters that have the same x-coordinate.
- 2 different characters that have the same y-coordinate.

=== Synthesize
- When the "Game Over" screen is supposed to be off screen, what coordinates might hide it?
- What would be the coordinate of the dog _before it gets onscreen?_
- Why do we estimate? _Practice number sense, get better at working with numbers_
- What constitutes a good estimate?
- How can we improve our estimation skills? _Practice, get more comfortable with numbers and more comfortable with making guesses_
