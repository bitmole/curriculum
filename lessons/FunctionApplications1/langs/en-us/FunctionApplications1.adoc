= Function Applications

@lesson-description{Students practice using a new function alongside previously-learned functions to choose images for their game.}


[.left-header,cols="20a,80a", stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Apply previous knowledge of functions to new situations
* Use reasoning skills to select appropriate functions and combine their effects

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use different functions to transform images.
* I can write definitions for my transformed images.


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Discuss copyright and fair use guidelines with your students.   
* Instructional time may vary based on students’ experience with using Google Image Search.  
* Check beforehand for any issues the school Internet security blocker might cause with searching for images.  
* Alternate method of importing images using direct links: Put alternate method link here

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
* Students should be familiar with image manipulation functions.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

Students should be logged into WeScheme and have their completed “Game Design” worksheet.

== Explore: (10 min)

With their partner, students investigate the @link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=ysj93ZPFsu&, Game Template file} and write their observations.  

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
As students investigate the Game Template file with their partner, 
ask students to record what they notice, and then what they wonder.   
****

== Discuss: (10 min)

* *What familiar things did you see in the Game Template file?*
+
_``define``, `triangle`, ``circle``_
* *What were some unfamiliar things?  Any idea what they might do?* 
+
_Answers vary: `bitmap/url`, comments (pink lines of text), require_
* *What datatype is `GAME-TITLE`?  What datatype is `BACKGROUND`?* 
+
_``GAME-TITLE`` is a String, `BACKGROUND` is an Image_
* *What does `SCREENSHOT` return in the Interactions window?* 
+
_An image of the `BACKGROUND`, `PLAYER`, `TARGET`, and `DANGER` all together_
* *What do you think `bitmap/url` does?* 
+
_Answers vary: It consumes a String, which is a URL (an image location on the Internet) and produces the Image inside Wescheme_
* *Did anyone try pressing "Run"?  What happens when you press "Run"?* 
+
_Allow students to discuss what they see and what connections they see with the code_

*Copyright and Fair Use*

The students will be using images from the Internet for their game, and while this falls entirely under the "Educational Use" umbrella of Fair Use Guidelines, it is still important to make sure students of all ages understand the purpose of copyright law and the differences between educational and commercial purposes.  

== Practice: (10 min)

Guide the students through finding an image, saving it to their Drive, importing it into WeScheme, and defining the image value as `PLAYER`.  
_Students will change this image later on their own, this is just for teaching purposes._

=== Finding and Saving Images to Google Drive 

In Google, search for an image (an image of the Bootstrap logo is used here is an example).  Be sure to click the "Images" tab, and click "Tools" to select "Color" -> "Transparent".  This will filter and display images that have a transparent background, appearing as a light white/grey checkerboard pattern behind the character.

@image{images/finding-images-GIS.png, Finding Images on GIS,400,align="center"} 

Once an image has been selected, click it to expand and save the image to Google Drive. For file management, students could create a folder to store their game images. 

* If using a Chromebook, this is done by right-clicking and selecting "Google Drive" on the left for the save location.  
* On a PC or Mac, @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/SavingImagesGuide.pdf, follow this quick guide}. 

Once the image is saved to Google Drive, it can be brought in to WeScheme by using the "Images" button.  This will automatically bring in the image using the `bitmap/url` function, and students can run the code to see the image. 

Next, they can define the image as a value and make changes to it with the image manipulation functions `scale`, `rotate`, `flip-horizontal`, and `flip-vertical`.

****
MLR 8 - Discussion Supports: As students discuss, rephrase responses as questions and encourage precision in the words being used to reinforce the meanings behind some of the functions, such as `scale` and `flip-horizontal`. 
****

== Apply: (20 min)

With their partner, students search the Internet for images to use in their game.  They will need 4 images, one for each visual element of their game:

* `BACKGROUND`
* `PLAYER`
* `DANGER`
* `TARGET`

Students should:

* Save the chosen images to their Drive 
* Bring them into WeScheme
* Define the images as values 
* Plan out how to resize and reorient them in their game.
* Make sure the final version of each image is defined as either `BACKGROUND`, `TARGET`, `DANGER`, or `PLAYER`.

When finished, students should be able to type `SCREENSHOT` in the interactions window and see all four of their images appropriately sized and oriented.
