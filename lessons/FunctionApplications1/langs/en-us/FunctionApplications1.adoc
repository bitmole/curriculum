= Function Applications

*Students practice using a new function alongside previously-learned functions to choose images for their game.*


[.left-header,cols="20a,80a", stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Apply previous knowledge of functions to new situations

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use different functions to transform images.
* I can write definitions for my transformed images.


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Discuss copyright and fair use guidelines with your students.   
* Instructional time may vary based on students’ experience with using Google Image Search.  
* Check beforehand for any issues the school Internet security blocker might cause.  
* Alternate method of importing images using direct links: Put alternate method link here

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with image manipulation functions.

|Materials
|
* Workbook, writing utensil, computer

== Get Ready:

Students should have their computer, contracts page, and pencil.

Students should be logged into WeScheme and have their “Game Design” worksheet they completed earlier in _lesson link_

== Explore: (10 min)

With their partner, students investigate the @link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=ysj93ZPFsu&, Game Template file} and write their observations.

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
As students investigate with their partner, 
ask students to record what they notice and wonder about the template file. 
****

== Discuss: (10 min)

* What familiar things did you see in the Game Template file? _ `define`, `triangle`, `circle` _
* What were some unfamiliar things?  Any idea what they might do? _Answers vary: `bitmap/url`, comments (pink lines of text), require_
* What datatype is `GAME-TITLE`?  What datatype is `BACKGROUND`? _ `GAME-TITLE` is a String, `BACKGROUND` is an Image_
* What does `SCREENSHOT` return in the Interactions window? _An image of the `BACKGROUND`, `PLAYER`, `TARGET`, and `DANGER` all together_
* What do you think `bitmap/url` does? _Answers vary: It consumes a String, which is a URL (an image location on the Internet) and produces the Image inside Wescheme_

*Copyright and Fair Use*

The students will be using images from the Internet for their game, and while this falls entirely under the "Educational Use" umbrella of Fair Use Guidelines, it is still important to make sure students of all ages understand the purpose of copyright law and the differences between educational and commercial purposes.  

== Practice: (10 min)

Guide the students through finding an image, saving it to their Drive, importing it into WeScheme, and defining the image value as `PLAYER`. 
_Students will change this image later on their own, this is just for teaching purposes._

In Google, search for an image (an image of Mario is used here is an example).  Be sure to click the "Images" tab, and click "Tools" to select "Color" -> "Transparent".  This will filter and display images that have a transparent background, appearing as a light white/grey checkerboard pattern behind the character.

Once an image has been selected, save the image to Drive.  For file management, students should create a folder to store their game images.

Once the image is saved to Drive, it can be brought in to WeScheme by using the "Images" button.  This will automatically bring in the image using the `bitmap/url` function, and students can define it as a value. 

Students then use _Workbook Page ??_ to plan how they could resize and reorient the image.

.Strategies for English Language Learners
****
MLR 8 - Discussion Supports: As students discuss, rephrase responses as questions and encourage precision in the words being used to reinforce the meanings behind some of the functions, such as `scale` and `flip-horizonatal`. 
****

== Apply: (20 min)

With their partner, students search the Internet for images to use in their game.  _Workbook page_ is provided to help students organize.

Students should save the chosen images to their Drive, bring them into WeScheme, define them, and plan out how to resize and reorient them in their game.

When finished, students should be able to type `SCREENSHOT` in the interactions window and see all four of their images appropriately sized and oriented.
