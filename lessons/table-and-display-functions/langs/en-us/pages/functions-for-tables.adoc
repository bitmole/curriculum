Open the @starter-file{animals} and click "Run".

In the Interactions Window on the right type `animals-table` and hit "Enter" to see the default view of the table.

== Sort

*Suppose we wanted to see the names of the animals in alphabetical order...*

The `sort` function takes in three pieces of information:

* A table
* A column we want to sort the table by (declared using a String)
* The order in which we want the column sorted (declared using a Boolean)

@vspace{1ex}

Test out these two expressions in the Interactions Area and record what you learn about ordering below:

* `sort(animals-table, "Name", true)`
* `sort(animals-table, "Name", false)`


@n `true` sorts the table... @fitb{}{@ifsoln{from A-Z ... (after question 4 add) or from least to greatest}}

@n `false` sorts the table... @fitb{}{@ifsoln{from Z-A ... (after question 4 add) or from biggest to smallest}}

*Suppose we wanted to sort the `animals-table` by the `weeks` column to determine which animals were
adopted quickest...*

@n Do you think it would be more efficient to use `true` or `false`? @fitb{}{}

@n Test it out and add your thinking about @vocab{quantitative} columns to your explanations of `true` and `false` above.

@n Which animal(s) were adopted the quickest? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Snuggles, Nori, Toggle, Wade and Mittens}}

@n Some functions produce Numbers, some produce Strings, some produce Booleans. What did the `sort` function produce? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{a new table!}}

@vspace{1ex}

There are many many functions available to us in Pyret. We can describe them using contracts. The contract for `sort` is:

@show{(contract "sort" '("Table" "String" "Boolean") "Table")}

- Each contract begins with the function name: @fitb{10em}{sort}
- Lists the data types required to satisfy its Domain: @fitb{20em}{Table, String, Boolean}
- And then declares the data type of the Range it will return. @fitb{10em}{Table}

*Suppose we wanted to sort the `animals-table` by the `legs` column to determine which animals had the most legs...*

@n Fill in the blanks below with the code you'd use:

@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{sort}}{function-name} ( @fitbruby{20em}{@ifsoln{animals-table}}{Table},  @fitbruby{15em}{@ifsoln{"weeks"}}{column-name {two-colons} String}, @fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{true}}{order {two-colons} Boolean})

@n Which animal(s) had the most legs? @fitb{}{@ifsoln{Snuggles the tarantula}}

@n Think of another question you might answer quickly by sorting the table.

@fitb{}{}

@n What code would you write to answer your question?

@fitbruby{10em}{@ifsoln{sort}}{function-name} ( @fitbruby{20em}{@ifsoln{animals-table}}{Table},  @fitbruby{15em}{}{column-name {two-colons} String}, @fitbruby{10em}{}{order {two-colons} Boolean})
