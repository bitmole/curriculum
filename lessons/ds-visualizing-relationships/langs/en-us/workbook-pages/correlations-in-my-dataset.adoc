= Correlations in My Dataset

1, There may be a correlation between @fitbruby{15ex}{}{column} and
@fitbruby{15ex}{}{column}.  I think it is a
@fitbruby{15ex}{}{strong/weak}, @fitbruby{15ex}{}{positive/negative}
correlation, because @fitb{45ex}{} @fitb{45ex}{}. It might be
stronger if I looked at @fitbruby{45ex}{}{a subset of extension of my
data}.
