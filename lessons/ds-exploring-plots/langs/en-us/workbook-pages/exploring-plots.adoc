= Introduction to Computational Data Science

Many important questions (“What’s the best restaurant in town?”, “Is this law good
for citizens?”, etc.) are answered with data. Data Scientists try and answer these
questions by writing _programs that ask questions about data_.

Data of all types can be organized into *Tables*.


- Every Table has a *header row*, and some number of *data rows*.


- *Quantitative data* is numeric, and measures _quantity_, such as a person’s height,
a score on test, a measure of distance, etc. A list of quantitative data can be
ordered from smallest to largest.


- *Categorical data* is data that specifies _categories_, such as eye color, country of
origin, etc. Categorical data is not subject to the laws of
arithmetic -- for
example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors.

*Programming languages* involve different _datatypes_, such as Numbers, Strings,
Booleans and Images. Numbers are usually used for quantitative data, and other
values are used as categorical data.


- *Operators* (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `<`, etc.) are written between
  values. For example: `4 + 2`


- We can use *functions* (like `triangle`, `star`,
  `string-repeat`, etc.) by writing the
function name first, followed by a list of *arguments* in parentheses. For example:
`star(50, "solid", "red")`


- Functions have *contracts*, which specify the _Name_, _Domain_
  and _Range_ of each
function. The Domain tells us what type of data the function consumes, and the
Range tells us what it produces.
