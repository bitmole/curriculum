= Regression Analysis in the `animals` Dataset

I performed a linear regression on @fitb{20ex}{} and found
@fitb{20ex}{} correlation between @fitb{20ex}{} and
@fitb{20ex}{}. I would predict that a
1 @fitb{15ex}{} increase in @fitb{15ex}{} is associated with a
@fitb{15ex}{} @fitb{15ex}{} in @fitb{15ex}{}.
