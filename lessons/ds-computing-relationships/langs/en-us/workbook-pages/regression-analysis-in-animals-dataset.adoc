= Regression Analysis in the `animals` Dataset

I performed a linear regression on @fitb{20ex}{cats at the
shelter} and found @fitb{20ex}{a moderate (r=0.566), positive}
correlation between @fitb{20ex}{age of the cats (in years)} and
@fitb{20ex}{number of weeks to adoptoin}. I would predict that a
1 @fitb{15ex}{year} increase in @fitb{15ex}{age} is associated
with a @fitb{15ex}{0.23 week} @fitb{15ex}{increase} in
@fitb{15ex}{adoption time}.
