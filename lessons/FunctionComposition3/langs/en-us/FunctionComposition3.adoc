|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Explain the pros and cons of functions that depend on each other
* Write a function that explicitly uses another function

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain the pros and cons of functions that use other functions.
* I can write a function that uses another function.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* There are several ways to write the profit function - use this opportunity for discussion and to promote higher-order critical thinking.
* If students are struggling with understanding the basis of the problem, start by coming up with examples of cost and revenue.
* Ensure students understand the difference between "revenue" and "profit", and that "cost" refers to the cost of making the lemonade, not the amount Sally is charging.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.
* Students should be familiar with the Design Recipe.
