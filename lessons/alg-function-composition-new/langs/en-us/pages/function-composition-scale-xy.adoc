= Function Composition -- scale-xy

Youâ€™ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

[.center]
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
```
; scale/xy : Number Number Image -> Image       							 ; overlay : Image Image -> Image
```
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
```
# scale-xy :: Number, Number, Image -> Image      							 # overlay :: Image, Image -> Image
```
}

Let's start with a purple rhombus. 	@quad{18em}		 *Circle of Evaluation:* 	@quad{8em}	*Code:* @show{(sexp->code '(rhombus 40 90 "solid" "purple"))}


[.center] 
@show{(sexp->coe  '(rhombus 40 90 "solid" "purple"))}

Using the image described above as the *original*, draw the Circles of Evaluation and write the Code for each exercise below. 

[cols="1a,1a",stripes="none"]
|===

| @n A purple rhombus that is stretched 4 times as wide.

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

| @n A purple rhombus that is stretched 4 times as tall

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}


| @n  The tall rhombus overlayed on the wide rhombus.

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

| Challenge: Change the color of the original rhombus to red and overlay it on top of the image you just created. *Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}
