= Sampling and Inference

1) Evaluate the `big-animals-table` in the Interactions Area. This is the _complete_ population of animals at the shelter! 

2) Type each of the following lines into the Interactions Area and hit â€œEnter".
----
random-rows(big-animals-table, 10)
random-rows(big-animals-table, 40)
----
3) What do you get? @fitb{60ex}{Two tables, with 10 and 40 rows. Rows seem randomly chosen.}

@vspace{2ex}

4) What is the contract for `random-rows`? @fitb{60ex}{`# random-rows {two-colons} (t {two-colons} Table, size :: Number) -> Table}

@vspace{2ex}

5) What does the `random-rows` function do?

@span{.blankline}{Given a table and a sample size, it randomly selects that many rows from the table}

@span{.blankline}

6) In the Definitions Area, define `small-sample` and `large-sample` to be these two random samples.

7) Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing the proportion of males to females.

- The percentage of males in `tiny-sample` is @fitb{30ex}{~50% (answers will vary)}
- The percentage of males in `small-sample` is @fitb{30ex}{~50% (answers will vary _less_)}
- The percentage of males in the entire population is @fitb{30ex}{50.1%}


8) Make a `pie-chart` for the animals in each sample, showing the proportion of fixed to unfixed.

- The percentage of fixed animals in `tiny-sample` is @fitb{30ex}{~49% (answers will vary)}
- The percentage of fixed animals in `small-sample` is @fitb{30ex}{~49% (answers will vary _less_)}
- The percentage of fixed animals in the entire population is @fitb{30ex}{48.6%}

9) Which repeated sample gave us a more accurate inference about the whole population? Why?

@span{.blankline}{The large-sample was more accurate, because larger samples are more likely to represent the population they are drawn from}
