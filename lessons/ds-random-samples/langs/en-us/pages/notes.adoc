= Taking Samples

Computer Scientists may take *samples* that are subsets of a data set. If their sample is well chosen, they can use it to test if their code does what it's supposed to do. However, choosing a good sample can be tricky!

*Random Samples* are a subset of a population in which each member of the subset has an equal chance of being chosen. A random sample is intended to be a representative subset of the population. The larger the random sample, the more likely it is to be representative and the more likely it is that we can make inferences about the population.

*Grouped Samples* are a subset of a population in which each member of the subset was chosen for a specific reason.
