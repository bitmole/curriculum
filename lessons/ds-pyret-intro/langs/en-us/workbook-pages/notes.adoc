= Introduction to Programming in Pyret

*Programming languages* involve different _datatypes_, such as Numbers, Strings, and Booleans. Numbers are usually used for quantitative data, and other values are typically used as categorical data.
	- Numbers are values like `1`, `0.4`, `1/3`, and `-8261.003`.
	- Any decimal _must_ start with a 0. `0.22` is valid, but `.22` is not.
	- Strings are values like `"Emma"`, `"Rosanna"`, "Jen and Ed", or even `"08/28/1980"`.
	- All strings _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks.
	- Booleans are either `true` or `false`.

*Operators* (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `<`, etc.) are written between values (for example: `4 + 2`). 
	- Operators must always have a space around them. `4 + 2` is valid, but `4+2` is not.
	- If an expression has different operators, parentheses must be used to show order of operations. `4 + 2 + 6` and `4 + (2 * 6)` are valid, but `4 + 2 * 6` is not.
