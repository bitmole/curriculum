= Surface Area of a Rectangular Prism

@lesson-description{Students define the shapes used to build a rectangular prism, print them, cut them out, and build the rectangular prism. Then they use their model to calculate the surface area.}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of @vocab{surface area} and use that understanding to calculate surface area of @vocab{rectangular prisms}

| Student-facing Goals
|
* I can explain what @vocab{surface area} is.
* I can use my understanding of surface area to calculate the surface area of any rectangular prism.

| Materials
|[.materials-links]

* This lesson requires a printer, scissors and tape.
* Colored pencils will be useful for some students.

| Preparation
|

* Students will be generating files that need to be printed. If the computers they will be using are not connected to printers, make a plan for how printing will be coordinated.
* Make sure all materials have been gathered.
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* This lesson focuses on developing students' understanding of @vocab{Surface Area} of prisms, such that they can build their own formulas. Instructors are encouraged not to reference any pre-defined formulas during the exploration.
* If you have access to a color printer, you may want to encourage students to define each of the shapes in this file to be a different color solid rectangle.  The example code is written to use outline black rectangles with black & white printers in mind. If you think color would help your students and you do not have access to a color printer, students could easily color the rectangles with colored pencils before cutting them out.
* For some students it may be helpful to label the shapes they print with their areas before assembling them into a prism. 
* Some students may want to label the shapes with their face names before assembly.

=== Overview
This lesson focuses on developing an understanding of @vocab{surface area} of prisms.  Students build on their experience with writing code to define shapes.  They will define shapes for all of the faces of a rectangular prism, print them, cut them out, and build the rectangular prism. Then they will use their model to calculate the surface area and write code to do the same.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
Students should open the @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1qU_aWQgfHLX5vRsFiFPK8JxUUXXAu1Ha&v=8c4da7d, Prism Starter File} in their browser and click run.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Click run and type prism into the Interactions Area to see an image of a rectangular prism. Notice that the @vocab{faces} and @vocab{edges} are labeled. 

[.lesson-point]
Faces are the shapes on the outside of the figure. Edges are the line segments where the faces fo solid figures meet in each of the three dimensions. 

[.lesson-instruction]
- Click run and type prism into the Interactions Area to see an image of a rectangular prism. Notice that the @vocab{faces} and @vocab{edges} are labeled. 
- What shape are the faces of this prism? _They are all rectangles_
- Skip down to the code on line 21.
- It reads "lst = [list: front, ]" , which defines lst to be a list of values.
- This list should include all of the faces of the prism.  Right now it only includes front. Add the names of each of the remaining faces to the list. Order doesn't matter.
- Once you complete your list, go back up to line 19 and look at the definition for front. 
- Type front into the interactions area. What do you get?
- Insert defintions between front= and lst= for each of the faces that you listed, clicking run and testing them in the interactions area to make sure that they match the prism you started with.
- When you finish, click run and type print-imgs(lst).
- What do you notice? 
- Do you have enough shapes to cover all of the faces of the prism? 
- Once you do, read file comments to learn how to customize and print the faces to build your prism.

=== Investigate

Have students cut out and tape together the images they defined to form a 3-dimensional paper model of a rectangular prism. 

Students will then use their models to calculate the surface area.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Once you've built your prism, turn to task 2 and define surface area to calculate the area of the prism using width, length and height. 

=== Synthesize

[.lesson-instruction]
Share codes students wrote to define surface area. How many different ways did students write the code?

- Our goal for today was to expand our understanding of surface area.
- How did building the prism help you to understand surface area?
- How did writing the code for surface area help you to understand surface area?
