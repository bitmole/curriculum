@lesson-description{Students reverse engineer a videogame and research what takes to create a videogame.}

|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Identify the objects in a videogame that are changing.
* Use math language to describe what is changing about each object.
* Understand the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular videogame.


|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can identify the objects in a videogame.
* I can use math vocabulary to describe what is changing about each object.


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Students will need their own Google accounts.
* Take care to manage student expectations about what their game will be like.  Modern games are very complex!  


|Prerequisites
|
* No prerequisites

== Get Ready:

Students should be logged into 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme }
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org }
endif::[]
and have their workbooks with a pen or pencil.

== Launch: (2 min)

Play the 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org/run?publicId=sggzRzgU5T, NinjaCat demo game}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=0B32bNEogmncOQ25ZOHBoR3ZNcUE&v=80ba55b, NinjaCat demo game}
endif::[]
onscreen while students watch. Purposely make mistakes while playing the game, which should elicit responses/direction from students.  

== Explore: (10 min)

Students take turns playing the 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org/run?publicId=sggzRzgU5T, NinjaCat demo game}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=0B32bNEogmncOQ25ZOHBoR3ZNcUE&v=80ba55b, NinjaCat demo game}
endif::[] 
in pairs.   

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
As their partner plays, ask students to write down what they notice about the game.

Switch players, and ask students to write down what they wonder.
****

== Discuss: (10 min)
Students complete the
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/ReverseEngineerGame.pdf, "Reverse Engineer A Video Game"} worksheet in pairs.

Ask students:

* What did you notice?
* What did you wonder?
* What are the elements (characters, items, etc.) of the game? (These should be nouns.) _NinjaCat, dog, ruby, cloud, background, score_
* What about these elements is changing? _The position of the characters changes, the score changes depending on what what NinjaCat hits_
* What math words could we use to describe these changes? _A change in x-coordinate, y-coordinate, a change in value for the score_

== Discuss: (2 min)

Ask students to share out their favorite current videogame. Write the names of the games on the board.

== Practice: (10 min)

In pairs, students complete the
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/ReverseEngineerGame.pdf, "Reverse Engineer A Video Game"} worksheet a second time but using one of the games listed on the board.

== Discuss: (10 min)
Let students choose a current, popular game to discuss. 


Collect students estimates for each of the questions below. Students can use the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/Estimation.pdf, Estimation} worksheet to document their estimations.


* How long do you think it took to create that game? 
* Are there still people working on that game today?
* How many people do you think it takes to create a game like this?
* How much money does it take to create a game like this? 
* Compare and contrast the number of elements and changing elements in NinjaCat vs their popular game.


Once students have made their estimations, have students use the Internet to research these questions and compare the actual numbers to their estimates.  


The goal here is not to discourage students from the possibility of eventually creating a game like their favorite game, but to manage expectations given our limited resources (time, money, and people).  By starting with this game project, students are learning transferable skills that can help them later on in learning new programming languages and creating bigger projects.


== Create/Apply: (15 min)

Students will research their own favorite videogame and answer the following:

* What are the elements of this game?  
* How long did it take to create this videogame?
* How many people did it take to create this game?
* How much did it cost to create this videogame?
