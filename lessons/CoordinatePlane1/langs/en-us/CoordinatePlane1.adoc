|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Identify the objects in a videogame that are changing/varying.
* Understand the time, money, and resources it takes to create a popular videogame.


|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can identify the objects in a videogame.
* I can identify what specifically is changing about each object.
* I brainstorm a basic videogame with their partner.


|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Take care to manage student expectations about what their game will be like.  Modern games are very complex!

== Get Ready:

Students should be logged into https://www.wescheme.org[WeScheme] and have their workbooks with a pen or pencil.

== Launch: (5 min)

* Option A: Teacher plays a videogame https://www.freetetris.org/game.php[Tetris] onscreen while students watch. Purposely makes mistakes while playing the game, which should elicit responses/direction from students. 
* Option B: Watch this video on eSports https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0zpF1c3aVA[eSports blurs videogames and sports] and then discuss with students why video games are so popular and whether they would ever participate in eSports or attend an event.

== Explore: (10 min)

Students take turns playing the https://www.wescheme.org/run?publicId=sggzRzgU5T[Ninja Cat game] file in pairs.   

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
As their partner plays, ask students to write down what they notice.

As their partner plays, ask students to write down what they wonder.
****

== Discuss: (10 min)
Students complete the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6ice3yQ6auq4zVU9_YAujxFuxEIraKXuR0ihMaJQ1U/copy[Reverse Engineer] handout in pairs.

* What did you Notice?
* What did you Wonder?
* What are the elements in the game? (looking for nouns)
* What specifically about these elements is changing?(also looking for nouns, ex: position)

== Discuss: (2 min)

Ask students to share out their favorite current videogame. Write at least 10 of the games on the board.

== Practice: (10 min)

In pairs, students complete the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e6ice3yQ6auq4zVU9_YAujxFuxEIraKXuR0ihMaJQ1U/copy[Reverse Engineer] handout a second time but using one of the 10 games listed on the board.

== Discuss: (5 min) - Estimation 180
Choose a popular game to discuss: (example: Fortnite). Collect students estimates for each of the questions below and then show them the actual amounts. Students can use the https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WObz4aczEfd7vqxAnfYwp1NT0OZ7cge8hWB2ESc_UUk/edit?usp=sharing[Estimation] handout to document their estimations.

* How long do you think it takes to create Fortnite? 
* How many people do you think it takes to create Fortnite?
* How much money does it take to create Fortnite? 

* Compare and Contrast the number of elements and changing elements in NinjaCat vs their Popular game.

The goal here is not to discourage students from the possibility of eventually creating a game like their favorite game but to temper expectations given our limited resources(time, money, people).


== Create/Apply: (15 min)

Students will research their own favorite videogame and answer the following:

* What are the elements of this game that makes it so fun?
* How long did it take to create this videogame?
* How many people did it take to create this game?
* How much did it cost to create this videogame?
