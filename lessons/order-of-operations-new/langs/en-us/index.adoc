| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered


| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Error messages are the computer trying to give us a clue that something is wrong.  Model reacting to @vocab{error messages} with interest to demonstrate to students that the messages are a helpful tool.
* After the first few exercises in creating Circles of Evaluation, ask students whether they create them from the 'inside-out' (drawing the inner circles first) or from the 'outside-in.'  After they've given their responses, have them try using the OTHER way!
* Up until now, we didn't have a visual spatial model for explaining the order of operations. Ask students to compare Circles of Evaluation to previous methods they've learned (PEMDAS, GEMDAS, etc)
* For a memory hook, model the "bug that crawls through the circle" explanation.
* Students may benefit from using multiple colors to distinguish between the different smaller expressions and parentheses.

== Order of Operations @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are given a challenging expression that exposes common misconceptions about order of operations. The goal is to demonstrate that a brittle, fixed notion of order of operations is _not good enough_, and lead students to a deeper understanding of Order of Operations as a grammatical device. The Circles of Evaluation are introduced as "sentence diagramming for arithmetic".

=== Launch

Humans also use verbs like "throw", "run", "build" and "jump" to describe operations on these nouns. Mathematics has @vocab{functions} - or "operations" - like addition and subtraction, which are operations performed on values. Just as you can "*spread* _mustard_ on _bread_", a person can also "*add* _four_ and _five_".

A mathematical expression is like a sentence: it’s an instruction for doing something. The expression @smath{(+ 4 5)} tells us to add 4 and 5. To evaluate an expression, we follow the instructions in the expression. The expression @smath{(+ 4 5)} evaluates to 9.

@span{.right}{@image{images/pemdas.png, "", 300, ""}}
Sometimes, we need multiple expressions to accomplish a task, and it will matter in which order they come. For example, if you were to write instructions for making a sandwich, it would matter very much which instruction came first: melting the cheese, slicing the bread, spreading the mustard, etc. The order of functions matters in mathematics, too.

Mathematicians didn’t always agree on the order of operations, but now we have a common set of rules for how to evaluate expressions. The pyramid on the right summarizes the order. When evaluating an expression, we begin by applying the operations written at the top of the pyramid (multiplication and division). Only after we have completed all of those operations can we move down to the lower level. If both operations are present (as in @smath{(+ 4 (- 2 1))}), we read the expression from left to right, applying the operations in the order in which they appear.

@span{.clear}{}

[.lesson-instruction]
But this set of rules is brittle, and doesn't always make it clear what we need to do. Check out the expression below. What do you think the answer is?  This math problem went viral on social media recently, with math teachers arguing about what the answer was! Why might they disagree on the solution?

@math{6 \div 2(1 + 2)}

Order of Operations mneumonic devices like PEMDAS, GEMDAS, etc focus on how to get the answer. What we need is a __better way to read math__.

Instead of a rule for computing answers, let's start by diagramming the math itself! We can _draw the structure_ of this grammar in mathematics using something called the *Circles of Evaluation*. The rules are simple:

[.lesson-point]
1) Every Circle must have one - and only one! - function, written at the top.

That means that Numbers (e.g. - `3`, `-29`, `77.01`...) are still written by themselves. It's only when we want to _do something_ like add, subtract, etc. that we need to draw a Circle.

[.lesson-point]
2) The inputs to the function are written left-to-right, in the middle of the Circle.

If we want to draw the Circle of Evaluation for @smath{(/ 6 3)}, the division function (`/`) is written at the top, with the `6` on the left and the `3` on the right.

[.centered-image]
@show{(sexp->coe '(/ 6 3))}
@span{.clear}{}

What if we want to use multiple functions? How would we draw the Circle of Evaluation for @smath{(/ 6 (+ 1 2))}? Drawing the Circle of Evaluation for the @smath{(+ 1 2)} is easy. But how do we divide 6 by that circle?

*Circles can contain other Circles*

We basically replace the `3` from our earlier Circle of Evaluation with _another_ Circle, which adds 1 and 2!

*Circles of Evaluation _help us write code_*

When converting a Circle of Evaluation to code, it's useful to imagine a spider crawling through the circle from the left and exiting on the right. The first thing the spider does is cross over a curved line (an open parenthesis!), then visit the operation - also called the _function_ - at the top. After that, she crawls from left to right, visiting each of the inputs to the function. Finally, she has to leave the circle by crossing another curved line (a close parenthesis).

Practice creating Circles of Evaluation using the common operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).

- Do spaces matter when typing in functions?
- Does the order of the numbers matter in the functions? Which functions?
- What do the error messages tell us?
- What connections do you see between the expression, circle, and code?

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
- Why are there two closing parentheses in a row, at the end of the code?

}

*Circles of Evaluation _help us get the correct answer_*

Aside from helping us catch mistakes before they happen, Circles of Evaluation are also a useful way to think about _transformation_ in mathematics. For example, you may have heard that "addition is commutative, so @smath{(+ a b)} can always be written as @smath{(+ b a)}." For example, @smath{(+ 1 2)} can be transformed to @smath{(+ 2 1)}.

Suppose another student tells you that @smath{(+ 1 (* 2 3))} can be rewritten as @smath{(+ 2 (* 1 3))}. This is obviously wrong, but __why__? *Take a moment to think: what's the problem?*

We can use the Circles of Evaluation to figure it out!

The first Circle is just the original expression. The second expression represents what the (incorrect) commutativity transformation gives us:
[.embedded, cols="^.^3,^.^1,^.^3", grid="none", stripes="none" frame="none"]
|===
| @show{(sexp->coe '(+ 1 (* 2 3)))}
| __?__ &rarr;
| @show{(sexp->coe '(+ 2 (* 1 3)))}
|===

In this case, the student __failed to see the structure__, viewing the term to the right of the @smath{+} sign as @smath{2} instead of @smath{(* 2 3)}. The Circles of Evaluation help us see the structure of the expression, rather than forcing us to construct it and keep it in our heads.

The Circles of Evaluation are a critical pedagogical tool in this course. They place the focus on the _structure_ of mathematical expressions, as a means of combating the harmful student belief that the only thing that matters is the _answer_. They can be used to diagram arithmetic sentences to expose common misconceptions about Order of Operations, and make an excellent scaffold for tracing mistakes when a student applies the Order of Operations incorrectly. They are also a bridge representation, which naturally connects to function composition and converting arithmetic into code.

@span{.title}{Pedagogy Note:}

Circles of Evaluation are a great way to get older students to reengage with (and finally understand) Order of Operations while their focus and motivation are on learning to code.  Because we recognize this work to be so foundational, and know that some teachers choose to spend a whole week on it, we have developed lots of additional materials to help scaffold and stretch. Look for them in the additional resources section at the the end of the lesson.

This is big conceptual terrain.  If you have time, the two pages in the student workbook that scaffold translating circles to code are a great place to start: (@printable-exercise{pages/complete-code-from-coe.adoc} and @printable-exercise{pages/match-coe-to-code.adoc}).  We have also included one page of more complex problems (@printable-exercise{pages/translate-arithmetic-to-circles-and-code-challenge.adoc}) in the student workbook so that you're ready to challenge students who fly. 

|===

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @printable-exercise{pages/translate-arithmetic-to-coe-and-code-1-intro-w-parenth.adoc} page in the student workbook. Be sure to __draw all of the Circles first__ and check your work before converting to code.
- Then complete @printable-exercise{pages/translate-arithmetic-to-coe-and-code-2-outro.adoc}
- If time allows, take turns entering the code into the editor with your partner.

@ifproglang{pyret}{
*Note:* In Pyret, we treat _operators_ like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` differently - they are written in between their inputs, just like in math. We also use letters instead of symbols for function names, so taking the square root is written as `num-sqrt` and squaring is written as `num-sqr`.
}

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
*Note:* In WeScheme, we use `sqrt` as the name of the square root function, and `sqr` as the function that squares its input.
}

== From Circles to Code @duration{optional}

=== Overview

Circles of Evaluation are a powerful tool that can be used without ever getting students on computers. If you have time to introduce students to the @ifproglang{wescheme}{@link{https://www.wescheme.org, wescheme}} @ifproglang{pyret}{@link{https://code.pyret.org, pyret}} editor, typing their code into the interactions area gives students a chance to get feedback on their use of parentheses as well as the satisfaction of seeing their code successfully evaluate the expressions they've generated.

=== Launch

[.lesson-instruction]
- Open @ifproglang{wescheme}{@link{https://www.wescheme.org, wescheme}} @ifproglang{pyret}{@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org (CPO)} } and click run.
- For now, we are only going to be working in the interactions area on the right hand side of your screen.
- Type @show{(sexp->code '(+ (* 8 2) (/ 6 3)))} into the interactions area.  
- Notice how the editor highlights pairs of parentheses to help you confirm that you have closed each pair.
- Hit enter/return. What happens? _If you typed the code correctly you'll get 18. If you make a mistake with your typing, the computer should help you identify your mistake so that you can correct it and try it again!_
- Take a few minutes to go back and test each line of code you wrote on the pages you've completed by typing them into the Interactions Area. Use the error messages to help you identify any missing characters and edit your code to get it working.

=== Explore

[.lesson-instruction]

Here are two Circles of Evaluation. 

[cols="1,1", grid="none", frame="none"]
|===
| @span{.right}{@show{(sexp->coe `(* 10 -4))}}
|@show{(sexp->coe `(text "Good work, gumshoe!" 50 "solid" "blue"))}
|===

One of them is familiar, but the other is very different from what you've been working with. What's different about the Circle on the right? 
--
_Possible responses:_

- _We've never seen the function `text` before_
- _We've never seen words used in a Circle of Evaluation before_
- _We've never seen a function take in three inputs_
- _We've never seen a function take in a mix of Numbers and words_

[.lesson-instruction]

- Can you figure out the Name for the function in the second Circle? This is a chance to look for and make use of structure in deciphering a novel expression!
_We know the name of the function is `string`, because that's what is at the top of the circle._
- What do you think this expression will evaluate to? 
- Convert this Circle to code and try it out!
- What does the `50` mean to the computer? Try replacing it with different values, and see what you get.
- What does the `"blue"` mean to the computer? Try replacing it with different values, and see what you get.
- What does the `"solid"` mean to the computer? Try replacing it with different values, and see what you get. *If you get an error, read it!* It just might give you a hint about what to do...

Here is another circle to explore.
@show{(sexp->coe `(string-length "fun!"))}

- What do you think this expression will evaluate to? 
- Convert this Circle to code and try it out!
--

=== Synthesize

Now that we understand the structure of Circles of Evaluation, we can use them to write code for any function!
