= Order of Operations (Circles of Evaluation)

@lesson-description{Students learn to model arithmetic expressions with the visual tool for order of operations and function composition known as Circles of Evaluation.}

[@lesson-intro-table]

@prereqs-stds{alg-coordinate-plane-1,alg-coordinate-plane-2}
| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Model an arithmetic expression using @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.
* Translate Circles of Evaluation into code.

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can write Circles of Evaluation for a given arithmetic @vocab{expression}.
* I can translate a Circle of Evaluation model into code.
* I can use numbers and operations in a programming environment.

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Error messages are the computer trying to give us a clue that something is wrong.  Model reacting to @vocab{error message}s with interest to demonstrate to students that the messages are a helpful tool.


* After the first few exercises in creating Circles of Evaluation, ask students whether they create them from the 'inside-out' (drawing the inner circles first) or from the 'outside-in.'  After they've given their responses, have them try using the OTHER way!


* Up until now, we didn't have a visual spatial model for explaining the order of operations. Ask students to compare Circles of Evaluation to previous methods they've learned (PEMDAS, GEMAS, etc)


* For a memory hook, model the "bug that crawls through the circle" explanation.   


* Students may benefit from using multiple colors to distinguish between the different smaller expressions and parentheses.


|Prerequisites
|
* Students should have knowledge of general arithmetic and the order of operations.

== Numbers @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students experiment with the Editor, exploring the different kinds of numbers and how they behave in this programming language.

=== Launch
Have students explore numbers - just numbers! - in the Interactions window.  Make sure both students take a turn at the keyboard.

=== Investigate
[.notice-box]
.Notice & Wonder
**** 
In pairs, students will each try entering a variety of numbers, then together they will write down what they notice and what they wonder.
****

- What type of numbers did you try?
- What did you notice? What did you wonder?
- Did anyone try any irrational numbers? (For example: pi, e)
- Did anyone try fractions? Decimals?
- Did anyone try negative numbers?
- Did you get any error messages?
- Did anyone try to add, subtract, multiply, or divide numbers? 
- What was the error message? 

=== Student Misconceptions
TODO - FILL IN

=== Synthesize
Our programming language knows about many types of numbers, and they seem to behave the way they do in math. Our Editor is also pretty smart, and can automatically switch between showing a rational number as a fraction or a decimal, just by clicking on it!

== Arithmetic Operations @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students are given a challenging expression that exposes common misconceptions about order of operations. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate that a brittle, fixed notion of order of operations is _not good enough_, and lead students to a deeper understanding of PEMDAS as a grammatical device.

=== Launch

Have students evaluate the expression in the image below and gather a few responses from the students.  Have they seen a problem like this on social media before?  Why might we be disagreeing on the solution?  How do we know how to evaluate this expression?

@centered-image{images/OrderOfOperationsFB.png, Puzzling Math Problem, 400, align="center"}
                                                 

Provide some direct instruction on Circles of Evaluation, such as how to:

* Create a Circle of Evaluation from an expression.
* Convert a Circle of Evaluation into code.

endif::[]                                          

ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
Have students practice creating Circles of Evaluation using the 6 functions(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, `sqrt`).
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
Have students practice creating Circles of Evaluation using the 6 functions(`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `num-sqr`, `num-sqrt`).
endif::[]

- Do spaces matter when typing in functions?
- Does the order of the numbers matter in the functions? Which functions?
- What do the error messages tell us? 
- What connections do you see between the expression, circle, and code?

endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@centered-image{images/CoE2-Pyret.jpg, Circles of Evaluation, 400, align="center"}
endif::[]  

- Why are there two closing parentheses in a row, at the end of the code?
- If an expression has three sets of parentheses, how many Circles of Evaluation do you expect to need?

=== Investigate
Option 1: Have students practice moving between Circles of Evaluation and code with a station review.

* Convert the expression into a Circle of Evaluation.
* Convert the Circle of Evaluation model into code.

Once the students feel confident in their work, they can enter the code into their code @vocab{editor} to test it out.

Option 2: Have students complete the 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@workbook-link{pages/OrderOfOperations1-Practice.pdf, Mixed Review worksheet }
and / or the 
@workbook-link{pages/OrderOfOperations1-Practice2.pdf, Square Roots worksheet }
endif::[]

@workbook-link{pages/OrderOfOperations1-Practice.pdf, Mixed Review worksheet }
and / or the 
@workbook-link{pages/OrderOfOperations1-Practice2.pdf, Square Roots worksheet }
endif::[]
with their partners and test their code in their coding environment.

[.lesson-instruction]
Students will create a Circle of Evaluation based on an expression theyâ€™ve created using at least 4 of the 6 functions:
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
	`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `sqr`, `sqrt`.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
	`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `num-sqr`, `num-sqrt`.
endif::[]

Using @workbook-link{pages/OrderOfOperations1-FrayerModelTemplate.pdf, this Frayer Model}, create the code that represents this circle, translate this into code, evaluate the expression using the order of operations, and then compare and contrast the three methods.
