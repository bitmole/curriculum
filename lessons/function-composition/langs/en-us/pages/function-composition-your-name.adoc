= Function Composition -- Your Name

Youâ€™ll be investigating these functions with your partner:

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
```
; text :: String, Number, String -> image    ; frame :: Image -> Image
; flip-horizontal :: Image -> Image          ; above :: Image, Image -> Image
; flip-vertical :: Image -> Image            ; beside :: Image, Image -> Image
```
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
```
# text :: String, Number, String -> Image   # frame :: Image -> Image
# flip-horizontal :: Image -> Image         # above :: Image, Image -> Image
# flip-vertical :: Image -> Image           # beside :: Image, Image -> Image
```
}

@n In the editor, write the code to make an image of your name in big letters in a color of your choosing using `text`.  Then draw the Circle of Evaluation and write the Code that will create the image.
