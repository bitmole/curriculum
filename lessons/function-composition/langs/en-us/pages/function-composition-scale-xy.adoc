Youâ€™ll be investigating these two functions with your partner:

[.center]
@ifproglang{wescheme}{
```
; scale/xy : Number Number Image -> Image       							 ; overlay : Image Image -> Image
```
}

@ifproglang{pyret}{
```
# scale-xy :: Number, Number, Image -> Image      							 # overlay :: Image, Image -> Image
```
}

| *The Image...*
| *Circle of Evaluation:*
| *Code:*

| @centered-image{../images/purple-rhombus.png}
| @show{(sexp->coe  '(rhombus 40 90 "solid" "purple"))}
| @show{(sexp->code '(rhombus 40 90 "solid" "purple"))}
|===

Using the image described above as the *original*, draw the Circles of Evaluation and write the Code for each exercise below. Be sure to test your code in the editor!

| @n A purple rhombus that is stretched 4 times as wide.

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

| @n A purple rhombus that is stretched 4 times as tall

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}


| @n  The tall rhombus overlayed on the wide rhombus.                                                                               .

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}

| Challenge: Overlay a red version of the original rhombus on top of the last image you constructed.

*Circle of Evaluation:*

@vspace{25ex}

*Code:* @fitb{44ex}{}
