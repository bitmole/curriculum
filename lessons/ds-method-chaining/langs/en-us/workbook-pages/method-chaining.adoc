*Method chaining* allows us to apply multiple method with less code:
For example, we can use method-chaining to write this:

  table.build-column("labels", nametag).filter(is-dog).order-by("age", true)

Instead of using multiple definitions, like this:

  with-labels = table.build-column("labels", nametag)
  dogs = with-labels.filter(is-dog)
  dogs.order-by("age", true)

*Order Matters!* The methods are applied in the order they appear. For example,
trying to order a table by a column that hasnâ€™t been built will result in an error.
