= Exploring Your Dataset

@lesson-description{Students summarize their dataset by exploring the 
data and identifying categorical and quantitative columns, datatypes, 
and more. They also define a few sample rows, random subsets, and
logical subsets.}

== Review (Time 10 minutes)

Open your saved animals-dataset file. You should have several functions defined:

- `is-fixed`
- `gender`
- `is-cat`
- `is-young`

If you didn’t have a chance to type them in from your workbook, make sure you do!

[.lesson-instruction]
Take 10m and write a function `is-dog`, then type it into the
Definitions Area.

== Exploring Your Dataset (Time 40 minutes)

[.lesson-instruction]
- Look at the spreadsheet for your data. What do you *notice*? What
  do you *wonder*? Complete
  @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/my-dataset.adoc}, making sure to have at least
  two Lookup Questions, two Compute Questions, and two Relate
  Questions.
- In the Definitions Area, use `random-rows` to define *at least
  three* tables of different sizes: `tiny-sample`, `small-sample`, and
  `medium-sample`.
- In the Definitions Area, use `.row-n` to define *at least three*
  values, representing different rows in your table.
- Take a minute to think about subsets that might be useful for
  your dataset. Name these subsets and write the Pyret code to
  test an individual row from your dataset on
  @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/samples-from-my-dataset.adoc}.

Have students share back.

[.lesson-instruction]
Turn to
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/design-recipe-helper-funs.adoc},
and use the Design Recipe to write the filter functions that you
planned out on
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/samples-from-my-dataset.adoc}.
When the teacher has checked your work, type them into the
Definitions Area and use the `.filter` method to define your new
subset tables.

[.lesson-instruction]
Choose one categorical column from your dataset, and try making a
bar or pie-chart for the whole table. Now try making the same
display for each of your subsets. Which is most representative of
the entire column in the table?

////
Have students share back. Encourage students to read their
observations aloud, to make sure they get practice saying and
hearing these observations.

== Closing (Time 5 minutes)

Congratulations! You’ve explored the Animals dataset, formulated
your own and begun to think critically about how questions and
data shape one another. For the rest of this course, you’ll be
learning new programming and Data Science skills, practicing them
with the Animals dataset and then applying them to your own data.

////
Have students share which dataset they chose, and pick one question they’re looking at.
