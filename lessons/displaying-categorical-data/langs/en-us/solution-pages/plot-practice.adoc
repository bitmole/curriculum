= Practice Plotting

Use Pyret to make the following displays:

@vspace{2ex}

. A `pie-chart` showing the `species` of animals from the shelter.
`pie-chart(animals-table, "species")`

. A `bar-chart` showing the `sex` of animals from the shelter.
`bar-chart(animals-table, "sex")`

. A `pie-chart` showing how many animals are fixed or not.
`pie-chart(animals-table, "fixed")`

. A `histogram` of the number of `pounds` that animals weigh.
`histogram(animals-table, "pounds", 10)`

. A `box-plot` of the number of `weeks` that it takes animals to be adopted.
`box-plot(animals-table, "weeks")`

. A `histogram` of the number of `weeks` that it takes animals be adopted.
`histogram(animals-table, "weeks", 2)`

. A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `pounds` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.
`scatter-plot(animals-table, "name", "age", "pounds")`

. A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `species` as the labels, `age` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.
`scatter-plot(animals-table, "species", "age", "weeks")`

. A `scatter-plot`, using the animals `name` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.
`scatter-plot(animals-table, "name", "pounds", "weeks")`

. (Challenge) An `lr-plot`, using the animals `species` as the labels, `pounds` as the x-axis, and `weeks` as the y-axis, for all the animals from the shelter.
`scatter-plot(animals-table, "species", "pounds", "weeks")`
