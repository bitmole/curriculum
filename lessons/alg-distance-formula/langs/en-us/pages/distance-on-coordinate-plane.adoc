= Distance on the Coordinate Plane

Distance between the pyret and the boot:

[.center]
@show{(sexp->code `(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length 9 -3)) (sqr (line-length 3 -2)))))} 

@centered-image{../images/coordinates-1.png,"", 600}		

Explain how the code works.

@span{.blankline}{}

@centered-image{../images/coordinates-2.png,"", 450}		

Now write the code to find the distance between this boot and pyret.
