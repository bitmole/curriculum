The distance between x1 and x2 is computed by @show{(sexp->code `(line-length x1 x2))}. The distance between y1 and y2 is computed by @show{(sexp->code `(line-length y1 y2))}. Below is the equation to compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle with those amount for legs:

[.center.big]
@math{\sqrt{line\mbox{-}length(x1, x2)^2 + line\mbox{-}length(y1, y2)^2}}

*1. Translate the math above into a Circle of Evaluation below*.

*2. Convert the Circle of Evaluation to Code below*.

[.center.big]
@show{(if *solutions-mode?* (sexp->code `(sqrt (+ (sqr (line-length x1 x2)) (line-length x1 x2)))) "")}
