| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* The distance formula is an excellent review of @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}. Have students work out the expression in small groups to foster discussion.

== Warmup

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme     } }
@ifproglang{pyret}{    @link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org } }
on their computer.

== Distance @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Students discover the need for distance calculation (first in one dimention, then in two) in videogames.

=== Launch

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
Have students open this @link{https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=PJMfrSvGRl, game file} and investigate. +
}
@ifproglang{pyret}{
Have students run this @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1g_3AqB4v6Jtq6TzcIHYNTkvlW9B6dLHS&v=882d33a, game file} and investigate. +
}

{empty}

- What seems to be missing from this game?
+
_The characters aren't doing anything when they collide._

- Why are the characters moving by each other?
+
_We haven't given the game any instructions on what to do when the characters get close._

- What does it mean for characters to 'hit' one another? To collide?
+
_They have to be in the same place at the same time._

- How will the computer know when the characters have collided?
+
_When the coordinates of the characters are really close to each other._

Role-Play: Ask a volunteer to help role-play two characters colliding. Stand about 10 steps away from one another and side-step towards each other one step at a time, while asking, "True or False: we colliding!"

Do this until students can clearly see it's when the two characters are 'touching' or 'overlapping' in some way - NOT when they are 'at the same point.' Don't worry too much about clarifying the difference now, they will be able to see the differences with their own images very soon.

[.lesson-instruction]
Have students explore using the `line-length` function in the @vocab{Interactions area}.

|
@span{.title}{Extension}

You can extend this `line-length` activity into a lesson on absolute value and have students program `line-length` themselves. Computing 1-dimensional distance - and absolute value - are in fact piecewise functions!

@ifproglang{wescheme}{
Have students open this new @link{https://www.wescheme.org/view?publicId=0bCivugY3P, game file} and investigate. +

@ifproglang{pyret}{
Have students run this new @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=1y1eWn1YyDDqilj0MFqEpMy4egVh-G81W&v=882d33a, game file} and investigate. +

@span{.title}{Notice and Wonder}

What do you Notice? What do you Wonder?
|===

* What kind of triangles are these?
+
_Right triangles._
* What do the numbers represent?
+
_Let students discuss - the numbers should represent the lengths of the sides, but one side is always showing 0._
+
The missing length on the right triangle is the *hypotenuse*. The *legs* of the triangle show the length of each side, or the *distance* between those points on the number line. +
{empty} +

@span{.title}{Extension}
@span{.right}{ @image{images/Pythag_anim.gif} }

You can take this activity further by having students prove the distance formula by solving for the @vocab{hypotenuse} of a right triangle. @link{https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/, This page} from Cut the Knot includes a number of different proofs. Proof #4 is especially well-suited for students who may be uncomfortable with symbol manipulation, and need more of a geometric proof. The animation on the right is a demonstration of this proof.

=== Investigate

Optional: Have students use this @exercise-link{pages/Distance-Multiple-Representations.pdf, Graphic Organizer} to model the distance formula with the Circles of Evaluation and translate it to code. +
{empty} +

[.lesson-instruction]
Using @workbook-link{pages/distance.adoc, Design Recipe: distance},
have students write a function that takes in two @vocab{coordinate} pairs (four numbers) of two characters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and returns the distance between those two points. +
{empty} +

Students can test their `distance` function using *Pythagorean triples*, such as (3, 4, 5) or (5, 12, 13), to make sure the function is calculating the distance correctly.

=== Common Misconceptions

- It is _extremely common_ for students to put variables in the *wrong order*. In other words, their program looks like
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ `...(sqrt (+ (sqr (- x1 y1)) (sqr (- x2 y2))))...` 
instead of `...(sqrt (+ (sqr (- x2 x1)) (sqr (- y2 y1))))...` }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ `...num-sqrt(num-sqr(x1 - y1) + num-sqr(x2 - y2))...` 
instead of `...num-sqrt(num-sqr(x2 - x1) + num-sqr(y2 - y1))...` }

In this situation, remind student to look back at what they circled and labeled in the examples step. _This is why we label!_ 

== Collision Detection @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students once again see function composition at work, as they compose a simple inequality with the `distance` function they've created.

=== Launch
Knowing how far apart our characters are is the first step. We still need the computer to be asking: "True or False: is there a collision?"

=== Investigate
Using
@ifproglang{wescheme}{ @workbook-link{pages/collide.adoc, Design Recipe: collision?}, }
@ifproglang{pyret}{ @workbook-link{pages/collide.adoc, Design Recipe: is-collision}, }
have students write a function that takes in two coordinate pairs (four numbers) of two characters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and returns a @vocab{Boolean} as to whether or not the two characters have gotten within 50 @vocab{pixels} of each other.

=== Synthesize
- Explicitly point out that this function is easy to write because we can _re-use_ the distance function. 
- Connect this back to `profit`, `revenue`, `cost` and `onscreen` from previous lessons. Function composition is powerful!
