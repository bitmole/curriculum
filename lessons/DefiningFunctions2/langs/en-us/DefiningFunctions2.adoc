= Defining Functions 2

@lesson-description{Students will apply the Design Recipe to a linear function problem.}


[.left-header,cols="20a,80a", stripes=none]
|===
|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Understand how to use the Design Recipe to break down word problems.
* Create a strong purpose statement that details in their own words what the function should do.

|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the @vocab{Design Recipe} to break down word problem when writing a @vocab{function}.
* I can identify the @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and other quantities in a word problem when writing a function.
* I can create and revise a strong @vocab{purpose statement} that explains what the function is doing.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|

* The *purpose statement* is a comment in the code - something the computer doesn't read.  It is important for readability of their code - there may be other people looking at their code and using their functions!
* Remind students that the domain and range of a function must be one or more of the three @vocab{data types} (Number, String, Image) they've learned so far.
* If students struggle with creating the examples, use the Circle of Evaluation mapping activity or use role-playing to help students build up their understanding around the concept.  

|Prerequisites
|

* Students should be familiar with @vocab{Circles of Evaluation}.
* Students should be familiar with defining values.
* Students should be familiar with the Design Recipe.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme} 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"] 
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org} 
endif::[]
on their computer.

== Launch: (5 min)

Ask students to open the 
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor?publicId=LGTVNvzrax, rocket-height} 
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"] 
@link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=13zlxZnvvQdW-UJVy8FlGOCwpjkiWGT56&v=f1d3c87, rocket-height} 
endif::[]
 program and play with this program for a few minutes while noticing and wondering. +
{empty} +

[.notice-box]
.Notice and Wonder
****
What do you notice about this program?  What do you wonder? 
****

Survey the class on their "Notices" and "Wonders" and record on the board before moving on to the discussion. +
{empty} +

=== Discussion starters

* *Is `rocket-height` working?*
** Why do you think it's not working?
** What do you think the *purpose* of this function is?  How do you know?
* *What is the domain of `rocket-height`?* +
_Number_
* *What is the range of `rocket-height`? How do you know?*
_Number, we can tell by looking at the @vocab{contract} for the function._
* *As the program is currently written, what happens when I give the function an input of 5?  15?  One million?* +
_It always returns 0._


== Practice (15 min)

We can use the Design Recipe to fix `rocket-height` and to introduce the *purpose statement*. +
{empty} +

Have students turn to the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DefiningFunctions2-EX1.adoc, rocket-height Design Recipe} and read the problem statement with their partner. +
{empty} +

****
*MLR 6: Three Reads* + 
Students will access the problem statement three times, looking and listening for different relevant information for the function.  Students will document their work in the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/PurposeStatement3ReadsStrongerClearer.pdf, Purpose Statement organizer}.

* 1st Read: Teacher reads the word problem aloud. Students discuss: What is the problem about? 
* 2nd Read: Partner A reads. Students discuss: What are the quantities?
* 3rd Read: Partner B reads. Students discuss: What is a good purpose statement?
****

[.strategy-box]
.Strategies for English Language Learners
****
*MLR 1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time* + 
Using the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/PurposeStatement3ReadsStrongerClearer.pdf, Purpose Statement organizer}, students will switch partners three times.  The purpose of this exercise is for students to read, listen and comprehend while also improving their own language in their purpose statement.

* 1st new partner: Read their purpose statements to each other & revise the purpose statement to be stronger and clearer.
* 2nd new partner: Repeat.
* 3rd new partner (if needed): Repeat.
****

Now that the students have revised and refined their purpose statement, have them write the *contract* and *purpose statement* on the @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DefiningFunctions2-EX1.adoc, Design Recipe} worksheet.

=== A good contract and purpose statement should contain all the relevant information from the problem statement.

==== Writing examples and the function definition

* Given the contract and purpose statement, write 2 examples of how `rocket-height` should work.
* Circle and label what's changing in the two examples, just as they did with their green triangle function before.  
* Choose a good variable name for what's changing.
* Write the function definition using the variable name.
* Once the Design Recipe has been completed in the workbook, students can type the code into the `rocket-height` program, replacing any incorrect code with their own code.

== Explore: (10 min)

Now that `rocket-height` is working correctly, explore the rest of the file and try the following:

* Remove the comment from before the `(start rocket-height)` and test the program.
* Put the comment back in front of `(start rocket-height)`, remove the comment from `(graph rocket-height)`, and test the program.
* Put the comment back in front of `(graph rocket-height)`, remove the comment from `(space rocket-height)`, and test the program.
* Put the comment back in front of `(space rocket-height)`, remove the comment from `(everything rocket-height)`, and test the program.
* Challenge: Explore the 3 variations of the program and try and get the rocket to blast off faster and reach the edge of the observable universe.


== Practice: (15 min)
Use the Design Recipe to write each of the following functions. Make sure to include:

* Contract & Purpose Statement
* At least two examples
* Function definition

Function options:

* Define a function ’purple-star’, that takes in the size of the star and produces an outlined, purple star of the given size. +
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DefiningFunctions2-EX2.adoc, Design Recipe: purple-star}

* Define a function ’spot’, that takes in a color and produces a solid circle of radius 50, filled in with that color. +
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DefiningFunctions2-EX3.adoc, Design Recipe: spot}

* Define a function ’average’, which takes in two numbers and produces their average.
@worksheet-link{workbook-pages/DefiningFunctions2-EX4.adoc, Design Recipe: average}
//// 
* A company logo is a word drawn in big, red letters, rotated some number of degrees. Define a function ’logo’, that takes in a company name and a rotation, and produces a logo for that company.
