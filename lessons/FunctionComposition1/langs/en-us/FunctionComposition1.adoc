= Function Composition
== Students encounter new image transformation functions and strengthen their understanding of Circles of Evaluation by using functions within other functions.

|===
| Lesson Goals 
| Students will be able to:

* Demonstrate understanding of the order of operations
* Use Circles of Evaluation to combine multiple functions, including non-Number producing functions

|Student-facing Goals
|
* I can use Circles of Evaluation to combine many kinds of functions.

|Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* Check frequently for understanding of @vocab{datatype}s and @vocab{contract}s during this lesson and throughout subsequent lessons.
* When students encounter errors, encourage them to check their Contracts page and show their work using Circles.
* Students will use their Contracts page frequently, so it should be kept in an accessible, convenient location.

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready: 

Students should be logged into WeScheme.

== Launch: (5 mins)
How did they make Ms. Pacman? - https://robertkaplinsky.com/work/ms-pac-man/[Video]

* How many different versions of the "Ms. Pacman" image are there?
_There is a right-facing, left-facing, up-facing, and down-facing version_

* If we have the left-facing version, how could we create the other three?
_Responses may vary. We could spin, or rotate, the image. We could rotate it and then flip it over._

== Explore: (10 mins)
Display the contracts for scale, rotate, flip-horizontal, and flip-vertical.

In WeScheme, have students create a text image of their name and experiment with their choice of these functions.  

== Discuss: (10 mins)
* What do all of these functions have in common? 
_They all produce images, they all change some element of the original image_
* Does using one of these functions change the original image? 
_No, it creates a whole new image_
* What does the number in ‘scale’ represent? 
_The scale factor, the percent by which the image should grow or shrink_
* What does the number in ‘rotate’ represent? 
_The rotation angle, measured counterclockwise_
* Suppose I wrote the code (scale 3 (star 50 “solid” “red”)).  What’s another line of code I could write that would produce the exact same image?
_(star 150 "solid" "red")_
* The domain and range for flip-horizontal is Image -> Image.  Why can I use the text function as an input for flip-horizontal? 
_Because the text function produces an Image, which is then used as the input for flip-horizontal_

Strategies for English Language Learners
****
MLR 1 - Stronger and Clearer Each Time: As an alternative, display the discussion questions during the last 5 minutes of the Explore and ask students to discuss the questions with their partner, asking each other for explanation and details and coming up with the clearest, most precise answer they can.
Student pairs can then share with another pair and compare their responses before moving into a full class discussion.
****

== Practice: (10 mins)
Students complete the workbook page, practicing drawing circles and writing code with their partner using different functions.  

Student-facing Task:
Create the circles and write the code for the following images.  Write a new line of code for each exercise.

* a solid green star of size 50
* a solid green star that’s 3 x’s as large as the original (using the scale function)
* a solid green star that’s ½ the size of the original (using the scale function)
* a solid green star of size 50 that’s rotated 45 degrees (using the rotate function)
* a solid green star that’s 3x as large as the original and rotated 45 degrees.

When students are finished, check their work, and ask them to change the color of all of the stars to “gold” or another color of your choosing.


== Create/Apply: (15 mins) 

Create an Image that uses the text function and at least 3 of following functions:

* rotate
* scale
* overlay
* flip-horizontal
* flip-vertical
* any other image producing function(triangle, star, circle, rectangle, etc..)

Write comments to describe what is being produced.
