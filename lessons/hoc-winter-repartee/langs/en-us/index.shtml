          <h1>1. Welcome to the Hour of Code!</h1>

          We're going to use Pyret to write programs that make images, and we've
          embedded a Pyret editor on the right-hand side of this page. 
          <p/>
          The Editor works like a chat program. You write lines of code, and the Editor runs each line and responds with the result. 
          <!----   <ol> = "Ordered List" (numbered list items) ---->
          <ol>
            <li>The <b>Update Responses</b> button will re-run every line</li>
            <li>You can also <b>click any line</b> to edit or change it</li>
          </ol>
          <p/>
          <!----   <div class="activity"> = "purple shaded box" ---->
          <div class="activity">Do a thing!</div>
        </li>

        <!----   Page 2 ---->
        <li editorCode=''>
          <h1>2. Making Images from Code</h1>
          What do you think the following code will do?

          <tt>star(50, "solid", "blue")</tt>

          Make a prediction, then <input type="button" value="click here" onclick='addToEditor(`star(50, "solid", "blue")`)' /> to add it to the editor and see the result!

          You can always <input type="button" value="reset" onclick="loadFromConfig()"/> the editor to where it was the first time you saw this card.
        </li>

        <!----   Page 3 ---->
        <li editorCode='
        star(50, "solid", "blue")
        '>
          <h1>3. Changing the Arguments</h1>
          You can also click on the code on the right to change it! Try changing the 50 to something else, and then hit "Enter" to save the change. What happens?

          Try changing the color.

          There are lots of other functions that will produce an image... some of them take the same arguments as star (a Number and two Strings).

          `circle`: Can you make a solid, green circle with a radius of 26?

          `triangle`: Can you make an outlined, red triangle of size 45?

          `square`: Can you make two different purple squares with side-lengths of 104?

          You can always <input type="button" value="reset" onclick="loadFromConfig()"/> the editor to where it was the first time you saw this card.
        </li>

        <!----   Page 4 ---->
        <li editorCode='
        rectangle(50, 100, "solid", "orange")
        '>
          <h1>3. More Images</h1>
          There are also image-producing function that need more arguments.

          Why does rectangle need an extra number?

          What do you think will happen if you switch the order of the numbers and click Run?

          NEXT CLICK

          Some other shapes require the same arguments as `rectangle` (Two Numbers and two Strings). 

          `ellipse`: Experiment with this function and see if you can figure out what an ellipse is.

          `right-triangle`: Experiment with this function and figure out why it needs two numbers, while `triangle` only needed one.

          You can always <input type="button" value="reset" onclick="loadFromConfig()"/> the editor to where it was the first time you saw this card.
        </li>

        <!----   Page 4 ---->
        <li editorCode='
        head = circle(42, "outline", "darkgrey")
        torso = circle(50, "outline", "darkgrey")
        base = circle(70, "outline", "darkgrey")
        '>
          <h1>4. Defining & Composing Functions</h1>
          What do you think will happen if you type `head` and click Run?

          Test it out.

          NEXT CLICK 

          How will that be different from typing `torso` or `base` and clicking Run?

          NEXT CLICK

          Defining functions simplifies the process of _combining_ them.

          What do you think this next line of code will do?
        </li>

        <!----   TEMPLATE PAGE ---->
        <li editorCode='
          ..some pyret code
        '>
          <h1>Some Header</h1>

          This is where you put instructions for kids

          You can always <input type="button" value="reset" onclick="loadFromConfig()"/> the editor to where it was the first time you saw this card.
        </li>
        
        <!----   Page 5 ---->
        <li editorCode='
        body = above(torso, base)
        '>

          Test out your theory by typing `body` and clicking Run.

          NEXT CLICK

          YOUR TURN: Can you place the head above the body?
        </li>

        <li editorCode='
        brim = rectangle(70, 15, "solid", "black")
        '>
          <h1>5.Composing a Top Hat</h1>

        YOUR TURN: Define `top` to be a solid black rectangle that is 50 x 30.

        NEXT CLICK

        Define `top-hat` to put the `brim` below the `top`.

        NEXT CLICK

        Can you make the same image using `above`?

      <h1>6.Choosing Image Placement</h1>
        Just as we can place an image `above` or `below` another image, we can also `overlay` an image on top of another image.
          <li editorCode='
        eye-white = circle(30, "outline", "black")
        pupil = circle(10, "solid", "black")
        overlay(pupil, eye-white)
        '>

        Click Run to see what happens. 

        NEXT CLICK

        Where on the eye-white does the pupil get placed?

        What do you think we'd see if we typed `overlay(eye-white, pupil)` instead? Test it out!

        NEXT CLICK

        Sometimes we want to be able to decide where the top image will land on the bottom image.

        This requires a function called `put-image`, which takes in two Numbers. 

        The first Number is the x-coordinate.
        The second Number is the y-coordinate.
        The bottom left corner of the bottom image is (0,0).

        What image do you think this `put-image` expression will generate? Let's test it out!

        <li editorCode='
        put-image(pupil, 10, 30, eye-white)
        '>

        NEXT CLICK

        YOUR TURN

        Use put-image to place the pupil on the center of the eye-white.

        NEXT CLICK

        Use put-image to place the pupil on the bottom of the eye-white.

        NEXT CLICK

        Use put-image to place the pupil on the eye-white wherever you think it makes the best looking googley eye!

        <h1>7. Parlay to Pyret</h1>
        
        IN THIS WINDOW WE WANT TO SEE THE CODE THAT THEY'VE ALREADY WRITTEN EMBEDDED IN THE DEFINITIONS AREA OF A PYRET STARTER FILE SO WE CAN TRANSITION THEM TO LOOKING AT PYRET PROGRAMS

        So far we have been working in the chatitor version of Pyret. More complex programs get written in a different view.

        Here you see our classic Pyret editor. 
        On the left side we have the definitions area. On the right side we have the interactions area.

        When we click "Run", the definitions on the left get loaded. Unlike in Parlay, definitions aren't automatically built. If we want to see the snowman, for example, we can type snowman into the editor and hit "Return" on our keyboard.
          <li editorCode='
        head = circle(42, "outline", "darkgrey")
        torso = circle(50, "outline", "darkgrey")
        base = circle(70, "outline", "darkgrey")
        body = above(torso, base)
        snowman = above(head, body)
        eye-white = circle(30, "outline", "black")
        pupil = circle(10, "solid", "black")
        eye = overlay(pupil, eye-white)
        googley-eye = put-image(pupil, 10, 30, eye-white)
        '>

      <h1>8. Winter Wonderland Puzzle</h1>

        On the next screen you will find an embedded program. When you run it, you will see an image with lots of pieces strewn about and it will be your task to edit the code to place the images such that they compose a winter wonderland scene.

        The pieces have been defined behind the scenes so you won't be able to change them... but you don't have to use them all and, once you have created an image that will make sense to other viewers, you can define any additional values you like!
