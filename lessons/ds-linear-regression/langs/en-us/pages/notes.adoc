= Computing Relationships

* *Linear Regression* is a way of computing the  *line of best fit*, which minimizes the
sum of vertical distances of all scatter plot points from the line. Calculating the
slope and intercept of this line is a task best left to computing or statistical
software.

** *Slope* provides us with the easiest summary to grasp: it's how much we
predict the y-variable (response variable) to increase or decrease, for
each unit that the x-variable (explanatory variable) increases

** *r* is the name of the  *correlation statistic*, which is also computed by linear
regression. The r-value will always fall between −1 and +1. The sign tells us
whether the correlation is positive or negative, and distance from 0 tells us
the strength of the correlation (−1 or +1 is really strong, 0 means no
correlation)

* [.underline]#*Correlation is not causation!*# Correlation only suggests that two column variables
are related, but does not tell us if one causes the other. For example, hot days
are correlated with people running their air conditioners, air conditioners do not
cause hot days!

* *Sample size matters!* The number of data values is also relevant. We'd be more
convinced of a positive relationship in general between cat age and time to
adoption if a correlation of +0.57 were based on 50 cats instead of 5.
