= Introduction to Programming in Pyret

*Programming languages* involve different _datatypes_, such as Numbers, Strings,
Booleans and Images. Numbers are usually used for quantitative data, and other
values are used as categorical data.


- *Operators* (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `<`, etc.) are written between
  values. For example: `4 + 2`


- We can use *functions* (like `triangle`, `star`,
  `string-repeat`, etc.) by writing the
function name first, followed by a list of *arguments* in parentheses. For example:
`star(50, "solid", "red")`


- Functions have *contracts*, which specify the _Name_, _Domain_
  and _Range_ of each
function. The Domain tells us what type of data the function consumes, and the
Range tells us what it produces.
