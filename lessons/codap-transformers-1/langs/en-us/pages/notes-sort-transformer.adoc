= Using Transformers: Sort, Filter, Transform Attribute, Build Attribute

*Transformers* allow you to transform datasets to produce new, distinct output datasets, instead of modifying the original input dataset itself. We use them to manipulate tables and enable low-stakes "what if?" exploration.

- In this course, we'll be using a variety of Transformers.

** `Sort` - We must provide `Sort` with a dataset, an attribute to sort, and a sort direction. `Sort` produces a copy of the input dataset, with cases sorted by the selected attribute.
** `Filter` - We must provide `Filter` with an expression that evaluates to either true or false. `Filter` then produces a copy of the input dataset that only has the cases for which the formula was true.
** `Transform Attribute` - We provide `Transform Attribute` with a formula to evaluate the new values. `Transform Attribute` produces a copy of the input dataset with the designated row transformed.
** `Build Attribute` - We provide a formula expression that to evaluate the attribute's new values. `Build attribute` produces a copy of the input dataset with the new attribute added.

- With the exception of `Sort`, each of the above Transformers is attached to a formula expression. It's important to get the formula expressoin just right, or the Transformer will produce an error.
