| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Put one image on top of another, using the `put-image` function.
* Decompose complex images into parts. 
* Combine and manipulate images to create more complex images.

| Student-facing Goals
|
* I can put one image on top of another.
* I can make complex images like flags.

| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered.
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs.

| Key Points For The Facilitator
|
* The `put-image` function treats the second image as the first quadrant of a cartesian plane. Having students sketch their flag on a sheet of graph paper drives this point home, and makes the programming easier.
* This is an excellent opportunity to introduce students to __indenting code__. The difference between poorly-indented flag code and well-indented flag code is extremely noticable.

== Putting Images Together @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn about the `put-image` function.

=== Launch
As you've already seen, `overlay` sticks two images together, so that the _center_ of the first image is placed exactly on top of the _center_ of the second image. But what if we want to put the dot somewhere besides the center?

The `put-image` function works like `overlay`, but instead of placing the centers of each image on top of one another, it _translates_ the center of the top image by some distance in the x- and y-direction.

[.lesson-point]
Think of the background image as a sheet of graph paper with the origin (0,0) in the bottom left corner.

The numbers in `put-image` specify a point on that graph paper, with the center of the top image being placed there.

Turn to @exercise-link{estimating-coordinates}. The width of the rectangle is 300 and the height is 200. *Estimate:* What coordinates for the `dot` would create each of the images on the page.  Write them in the spaces provided in the code.

- Type `japan` into the Interactions Area and compare the image to `japan-flag`.
- `japan` is composed using `dot` and `background`. Type each of those variables into the interactions area. What do you get back?
- Take a look at the `japan` code and fix it so that it matches the image from `japan-flag`.

=== Synthesize
Could we completely replace `overlay` with `put-image`? Why or why not?

== Making Flags @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students focus on decomposing complex images into simple ones, and using `put-image` to combine them.

=== Launch
Let's dig into the process for how the flags we’ve seen so far were made:

*1) Decompose the Image*

We observe that the Japanese flag is made up of two simpler images: a blank rectangle and a red dot.

*2) Define those parts*

We define `dot` and `background`. Once we’ve defined those images, we test them out in the Interactions Area to make sure they look right!


*3) Find the Coordinates*

For each image, calculate what the x- and y-coordinates of the center should be. __TIP: this is a lot easier if you have a sheet of graph paper handy!__


*4) Build the Image*

We stack the parts on top of the bottom image using the coordinates we found.
 __TIP: don't cram all the code into one line! If you break it up into new lines (for example, hitting "Return" before the x-coordinate and after the y-coordinate), you'll notice that the code forms a "staircase" pattern.__

and define those parts.

@span{.title}{Ratio and Proportion}

Have students define the `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` of their flags as values, and then __replace the numbers in each flag__ with expressions relative to width and height. For example, if the `dot` in the Japanese flag is at (150, 100), those numbers would be replaced with @show{(sexp->code `(/ WIDTH 2))} and @show{(sexp->code `(/ HEIGHT 2))}.
