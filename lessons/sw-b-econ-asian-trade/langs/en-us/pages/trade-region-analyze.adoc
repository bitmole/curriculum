Knowing what the ships carried tells us what people wanted to buy and sell. It doesnâ€™t tell us why those items were valuable. 

In the table below, you'll see several items from the cards. Complete the table by choosing a reason why people might have wanted the items from the list below (multiple items may have the same reason) and indicating where your evidence comes from (a card, general knowledge, etc.).
