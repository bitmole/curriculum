Jamalâ€™s trip requires him to drive 20mi to the airport, fly 2,300mi, and then take a bus 6mi to his hotel. His average speed driving to the airport is 40mph, the average speed of an airplane is 575mph, and the average speed of his bus is 15mph.

Aside from time waiting for the plane or bus, how long is Jamal in transit?

@math{Drive Time = 20 miles \times \frac{1hour}{40 miles} = 0.5 hours}

@math{Fly Time = 2300 miles \times \frac{1hour}{575 miles} = 4 hours}

@math{Bus Time = 6 miles \times \frac{1hour}{15 miles} = 0.4 hours}

@math{In Transit Time = Drive Time + Fly Time + Bus Time}

@math{0.5 + 4 + 0.4 = 4.9 hours}

@math{In Transit Time = Drive Time + Fly Time + Bus Time}

@math{Drive Time = 20 miles \times \frac{1hour}{40 miles} = 0.5 hours}

@math{Fly Time = 2300 miles \times \frac{1hour}{575 miles} = 4 hours}

@math{Bus Time = 6 miles \times \frac{1hour}{15 miles} = 0.4 hours}

@math{0.5 + 4 + 0.4 = 4.9 hours}

@span{.title}{What's happening with that Math?!}

In this problem, you may have noticed that when calculating Jamal's drive time, we multiplied @math{20 miles} by @math{\frac{1 hour}{40 miles}}. We chose to multiply by @math{\frac{1 hour}{40 miles}} rather than @math{\frac{40 miles}{1 hour}} because @math{time} is the desired outcome. This particular setup enabled us to _cancel out_ miles to get a solution in hours - exactly what we need for a problem about how long Jamal is in transit.

[.center]
@math{\frac{20 mi}{1} \times \frac{1hour}{40miles} = \frac{20\require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{miles} \times1hour}{40 \require{enclose} \enclose{horizontalstrike}{miles}} = \frac{20}{40} hour = \frac{1}{2} hour}
