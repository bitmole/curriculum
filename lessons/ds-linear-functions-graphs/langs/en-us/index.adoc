| Preparation
|
* Make sure all materials have been gathered
* Decide how students will be grouped in pairs
* Computer for each student (or pair), with access to the internet
* link:{pathwayrootdir}/workbook/workbook.pdf[Student workbook], and something to write with
* All students should log into @link{https://code.pyret.org, CPO} and open the "Graphing Starter File" they saved from the prior lesson. If they don't have the file, they can @link{https://code.pyret.org/editor#share=XYZ, open a new one} 

| Key Points for the Facilitator
| This lesson is designed to feel almost _eerily_ similar to @link{../ds-linear-tables-functions/index.shtml, Tables and Functions}. __This is entirely purposeful__. Teachers should not be afraid make explicit references to this, driving home the fact that Tables, Functions and Graphs are all connected.

== Function Notation and Graphs @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students consider graphs as another representation of functions.

=== Launch
Take a look at the following linear function on the left (shown as Pyret code and regular algebra) and graph on the right:

[.top-table, cols="^.^1a,^.^1a", frame="none"]
|===
| `fun f(x): 2 * x end`

@math{f(x) = 2x}

| @image{images/2x.png}

|===

* What do you *Notice*?
* What do you *Wonder*?

There's a definite connection between the function and the graph. If we apply this linear function to any point on the x-axis, it produces the y-value that falls on the line. Instead of drawing endless points repeating the same pattern, we can just declare the pattern itself using the function.

[.lesson-point]
When like terms are combined, linear functions have two terms.

@image{images/slope-and-y.png}

*Review:* We know that a linear function looks like a straight line when represented as a graph, which has a @vocab{slope} and a @vocab{y-intercept}. But what about when we read it as function notation? One of these terms has an @math{x} in it, and determines the @vocab{slope}. The other term is a number by itself, which is the @vocab{y-intercept}. Note: If there is no number by itself, the y-intercept is "invisible" and can be written out as _zero_.

=== Investigate

There are two strategies we could take to see if the function notation and graph match:

. Use the function to _compute_ some (x, y) pairs, and see if those fall on the graph.
. Find the _slope_ and _y-intercept_ of the function and graph, and see if they are the same.

Which strategy do you like best? Are there times when you would use one over the other?

=== Synthesize
For graphs that fit a pattern like this, a function can be a much shorter way of describing all of the points on the graph! In fact, a one-line function can summarize an _infinite_ number of points.


== Not all Graphs come from Functions @duration{15 minutes}

=== Overview
Students learn how to _build_ graphs with functions, and that not all graphs can be generated from linear functions.

=== Launch
We've provided a special function `make-graph` that takes in a starting point, an ending point, the size of the steps between them, and a function. It produces a __graph__ with those steps as x-coordinates and the output of the function as the y-coordinates. For example:

```
fun f(x): 0.5 * x end
# make a table with xs going from 0-10 in steps of 2
make-graph(0, 10, 2, f)
```

will produce:

@image{images/0.5x.png}

[.lesson-instruction]
* How could we change this code to make a graph for *all* the points between 0 and 10, instead of skipping by 2? 
* How could we change this code to make a graph for all the points between 20 and 200, skipping by 10? 
* How could we change this code to make a graph for a different function altogether? 
* Open the Table and Graphs Starter File, and try defining different functions and using them to build Tables.

=== Investigate
__Non-linear functions__ have terms that involve more than just @math{x}. They might have exotic terms like @math{x^2}, @math{\sqrt x}, @math{2^x} etc. These functions (e.g. - _quadratic_ or _exponential_ functions) have patterns of their own, and very differently-shaped graphs! 

[.lesson-instruction]
* Complete @exercise-link{define-functions-graphs.adoc}.
* What are some graphs that can't be made from linear functions?

_Any_ graph constructed from a linear function will have points that precisely follow a straight-line pattern. But not every graph follows a pattern like that! Can you tell which is which?

[.lesson-instruction]
Open @exercise-link{linear-nonlinear-bust.adoc}. Which of these tables can be summarized by a linear function? Which ones can't?

=== Synthesize
TODO(Emmanuel)
