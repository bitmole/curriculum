= The Distance Formula

*Students apply their knowledge of the Pythagorean Theorem to develop a function for the distance formula*

|Lesson Goals
|Students will be able to:

* Explain how the distance formula is related to the Pythagorean theorem.
* Write a function for the distance formula.


|Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can explain how the distance formula is connected to the Pythagorean theorem.
* I can write a function that takes in 2 points and returns the distance between them.

|Key Points for the Facilitator
|
* Key points

|Prerequisites
|
* Students should be familiar with Circles of Evaluation.

== Get Ready:

Students should have their workbook, contracts page, a pencil, and their computers with a https://www.wescheme.org[WeScheme] tab opened and logged into.

== Launch: (5 min)

Have students play this game file and jot down some noticings and wonderings.

== Discuss: (10 min)

* What seems to be missing from this game?
* Why are the characters moving by each other?
* How do you usually accumulate or lose points in a video game?
* What does it mean for characters to 'hit' one another? To collide?
* How will the computer know when the characters have collided?

Role-Play: Ask a volunteer to help role-play 2 characters colliding. Stand about 10 steps away from one another and side-step towards each other one step at a time, while asking, "Are we colliding, yet?"

Do this until students can clearly see it's when the 2 characters are 'touching' or 'at the same point.' Don't worry about clarifying the difference now, they will be able to see the differences with their own images very soon.

== Explore: line-length (10 min)

Have students explore using the `line-length` function in the Interactions window and jot down their noticings and wonderings.

.Extension
****
You can extend this `line-length` activity into a lesson on Absolute Value and have students program `line-length` themselves using `cond`.

== Explore: 2D distance(5 mins)

Have students open and play this game file and jot down their noticings and wonderings.

== Discuss: (5 min)

* What did you notice? What did you wonder?
* What kind of shapes do you see?
* What kind of triangle is it?
* What are the labels on the shapes?
* What side is missing the label?

Bring the discussion to closure by pointing out to students that the missing labeled side of the triangle is the hypotenuse of the right trangle and the legs are the difference in distances along the x and y axes of the characters. This hypotenuse length is actually the distance formula:

You can take this activity further by having students prove the distance formula by solving for the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

== Practice: (10 min)

Have students use this https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1mCJygY5elVQzy64zLLRyFVZ9-CkTnVYTBM3URnIfzEc/edit[distance formula Frayer Model] to model the distance formula with the Circles of Evaluation and translate it to code.

== Create/Apply: The Distance Formula(20 mins)

Have students write a function `distance` that takes in 2 coordinate pairs(4 numbers) of 2 characters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and returns the distance between those two points.

Students should test their `distance` function once it's finished using 'friendly' numbers to make sure it's calculating the distance correctly.

== Create/Apply: collide?(20 mins)

Have students write a function 'collide?' that takes in 2 coordinate pairs(4 numbers) of 2 characters (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and returns the whether or not the 2 characters have collided.
