== Introduction @duration{20 minutes}

=== Overview
Students look at opening questions, either at their desks or in a walk around the room. They select a question they are personally interested in, and think about the data required to answer that question. This process draws a direct line between answering questions they care about and the basics of data science.

=== Launch
[.lesson-instruction]
- Give students 2 minutes to choose a question that grabs their attention, and group themselves by question. Ideally, no student will be the only one interested in that question.
- Have students spend 2 minutes coming up with a hypothesis about what the answer is, and explaining why. Does every student in a single question-grouping have the same answer?

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Give students 5 minutes to think about what information they would need to collect, to find the answer.

=== Possible Misconceptions
Students may list information that isn't _data_. For example, "we would need to find out who the best player is". That's not data! Instead, students should be proposing things like "we would need to find out win/loss records, free throw percentage", etc.

==== Synthesize
What’s the greatest movie of all time? Is Climate Change real? Who is the best quarterback? Is Stop-and-Frisk racially biased? These questions quickly turn into a discussion about data -- how you assess it and how you interpret the results. In this course, you’ll learn how to use data to ask and answer questions like this. The process of learning from data is called @vocab{Data Science}. Data science techniques are used by scientists, business people, politicians, sports analysts, and hundreds of other different fields to ask and answer questions about data.

We’ll use a @vocab{programming language} to investigate these questions. Just like any human language, programming languages have their own vocabulary and grammar that you will need to learn. The language you’ll be learning for data science is called Pyret.

== The Animals Dataset @duration{25 minutes}

=== Overview
Students explore the animals dataset, sharing observations and familiarizing themselves with the idiosyncracies and patterns in the data. In the process, they learn about Categorical and Quantitative data.

=== Launch
Have students open the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19m1bUCQo3fCzmSEmWMjTfnmsNIMqiByLytHE0JYtnQM/edit#gid=0, Animals Spreadsheet} in a browser tab, or turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/animals-dataset.pdf} in their Student Workbooks. 

=== Investigate
This table contains data from an animal shelter, listing animals that have been adopted. We’ll be analyzing this table as an example throughout the course, but you’ll be applying what you learn to __a dataset you choose__ as well.

[.lesson-instruction]
- Turn to @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/animals-dataset-2.adoc} in your Student Workbook. What do you notice about this dataset? Write down your observations in the first column.
- Sometimes, looking at data sparks questions. What do you wonder about this dataset? Write down your questions in the second column.
- There’s a third column, called “Question Type” -- we’re going to return to that later, so you can ignore it for now.
- If you look at the bottom of the @link{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19m1bUCQo3fCzmSEmWMjTfnmsNIMqiByLytHE0JYtnQM/edit#gid=0, spreadsheet file}, you’ll see that this document contains multiple sheets. One is called `"pets"` and the other is called `"README"`. Which sheet are we looking at?
- Each sheet contains a table. For our purposes, we only care about the animals table on the `"pets"` sheet.

Data Scientists work with two broad kinds of data: Categorical Data and Quantitative Data. @vocab{Categorical Data} is used to _classify_, not measure. Categories aren’t subject to the laws of arithmetic. For example, we couldn’t ask if “cat is more than lizard”, and it doesn’t make sense to "find the average ZIP code” in a list of addresses. “Species” is a categorical variable, because we can ask questions like “which species does Mittens belong to?"

[.lesson-instruction]
What are some other categorical variables you see in this table?

@vocab{Quantitative Data} is used to measure an amount of something, or to compare two pieces of data to see which is _less or more_. If we want to ask “how much” or “which is most”, we’re talking about Quantitative Data. "Pounds" is a quantitative variable, because we can talk about whether one animal weighs more than another or ask what the average weight of animals in the shelter is.

[.lesson-point]
We use @vocab{Categorical Data} to answer “which one?”, and @vocab{Quantitative Data} to answer "how much?".

[.lesson-instruction]
--
* Turn to page @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/categorical-or-quantitative.adoc}, and answer the questions 1-5
* Sometimes it can be tricky to figure out if data is categorical or quantitative, because it depends on _how that data is being used!_
* On @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/animals-dataset-2.adoc} in your Student Workbook, fill in the blanks for questions 8-13.

==== Synthesize
Have students share back their noticings (statements) and wonderings (questions), and write them on the board.

Data Science is all about using a smaller sample of data to make predictions about a larger population. It’s important to remember that tables are only a _sample_ of a larger population: this table describes some animals, but obviously it isn’t every animal in the world! Still, if we took the average age of the animals at this particular shelter, it might tell us something about the average age of animals in other shelters.

== Question Types @duration{10 minutes}

=== Overview
Students begin to categorize questions, sorting them into "lookup", "compute", and "relate" questions - as well as questions that simply can't be answered based on the data.

=== Launch
Once we have a dataset, we can start asking questions! But how do we know what questions to ask? There’s an art to asking the right questions, and good Data Scientists think hard about what kind of questions can and can’t be answered.

Most questions can be broken down into one of four categories:

- *Lookup questions* -- These can be answered simply by looking up a single value in the table and reading it out. Once you find the value, you’re done! Examples of lookup questions might be “is Sunflower fixed?” or “How many legs does Felix have?”

- *Compute questions* -- These can be answered by computing an answer across a single row or column. Examples of computing questions might be “how much does the heaviest animal weigh?” or “What is the average age of animals at the shelter?”

- *Relate questions* -- These ones take the most work, because they require looking for relationships between multiple columns. Examples of analysis questions might be “Do cats tend to be adopted faster than dogs?” or “Are older animals heavier than young ones?”

- *Can't answer* -- These are questions that just can't be answered based on the available data. We might ask "are cats or dogs better for elderly owners?", but the animals dataset doesn't have information that we can use to answer it.

=== Investigate
[.lesson-instruction]
- Come up with examples for each type of question.
- Look back at the Wonders you wrote on @worksheet-link{ds-intro/workbook-pages/animal-dataset-2.adoc}. Are any of these Lookup, Compute, or Relate questions? Circle the question type that’s appropriate. Can you come up with additional examples for each type of question?

=== Synthesize
Have students share their questions with the class. Allow time for discussion!

=== Closing

Debrief with the class, and have students reflect on what they learned by writing on @worksheet-link{workbook-pages/whats-on-your-mind.adoc}. Some prompts that may be helpful:

* What new vocabulary did you learn?
* What question was exciting to you, and what data would you need to answer it? Is that data Qualitative or Quantitative?
* What do you hope to learn in the next lesson?
