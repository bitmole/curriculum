= Introduction to Computational Data Science

Many important questions (“What’s the best restaurant in town?”, “Is this law good
for citizens?”, etc.) are answered with data. Data Scientists try and answer these
questions by writing _programs that ask questions about data_.

Data of all types can be organized into *Tables*.


- Every Table has a *header row*, and some number of *data rows*.


- *Quantitative data* is numeric, and measures _quantity_, such as a person’s height,
a score on test, a measure of distance, etc. A list of quantitative data can be
ordered from smallest to largest.


- *Categorical data* is data that specifies _categories_, such as eye color, country of
origin, etc. Categorical data is not subject to the laws of
arithmetic -- for example, we cannot take the “average” of a list of colors.
