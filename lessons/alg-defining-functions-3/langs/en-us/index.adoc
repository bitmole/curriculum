= Defining Functions 3

@lesson-description{Students apply their skills in using the Design Recipe and writing purpose statements to a variety of word problems.}

[@lesson-intro-table]
|===
@prereqs-stds{alg-defining-functions-2}

| Lesson Goals
| Students will be able to:

* Understand how to use the @vocab{Design Recipe} to break down simple word problems.
* Create a strong @vocab{purpose statement} that details in their own words what the @vocab{function} is doing.

| Student-Facing Lesson Goals
|
* I can use the Design Recipe to break down word problem when writing a function.
* I can identify @vocab{domain} and @vocab{range} and other quantities in a word problem when writing a function.
* I can create and revise a strong purpose statement that explains what the function is doing.

| Key Points for the Facilitator
|

* The purpose statement, like the contract, is a comment - something that the computer doesn't read.  It's important for readability of their code - there may be other people looking at their code and using their functions!
* The domain and range of a function are described as @vocab{data types}, such as Number, String, or Image.
* If students struggle with getting started, encourage them to start with one example and use the Circles of Evaluation @vocab{example}s mapping organizer.
* This activity can work well as a formative review.
* This activity is a good time to get students working with someone other than their usual coding partner.

== Warmup

Students should have their workbook, pencil, and be logged into
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "wescheme"]
@link{https://www.wescheme.org, WeScheme}
endif::[]
ifeval::["{proglang}" == "pyret"]
@link{https://code.pyret.org, code.pyret.org}

on their computer.

== Focusing on Purpose Statements @duration{30 minutes}

=== Overview
Straight-up _practice_, focusing on the specific skill of writing a good purpose statement. Students practice with the Design Recipe and writing quality Purpose Statements.  This can be done with their usual coding partner, a new partner, a station review, or another format that suits the class.

=== Launch
Students will use the @workbook-link{pages/PurposeStatement3ReadsStrongerClearer.adoc, Purpose Statement organizer} and the Design Recipe worksheets to work through different problems from @workbook-link{pages/word-problem-prompts.adoc, Word Problem Prompts}.

.Strategies for English Language Learners
****
MLR 6: 3 Reads
In pairs, the word problem is read 3 times. Students will document their work in the "3 Reads/Stronger & Clearer" handout.

* 1st Read: Teacher reads the word problem. Without any pencil or pen, students discuss: What is the problem about?
* 2nd Read: Partner A reads. Students discuss: What are the quantities?
* 3rd Read: Partner B reads. What is a good purpose statement?

MLR 1: Stronger and Clearer Each Time
Using the "3 Reads + Stronger & Clearer" handout, students will switch partners 3 times.

* 1st new partner: Read their purpose statements to each other & revise the purpose statement to be stronger and clearer.
* 2nd new partner: Repeat.
* 3rd new partner: Repeat.

Students may choose to use the programming environment to test out their functions or to solve solution disputes.  Encourage students to try different strategies and @vocab{debug} their own programs as much as possible.

- *What strategies did you find the most helpful in solving these problems?*
_Encourage student discussion while making notes of preferred strategies on the board._
- *Did any groups disagree on how to solve a problem?  What did you do to resolve this?*

- *How can reading a word problem three times help you?
_Helps you to slow down and comprehend, makes time to look for information, gives you a chance to catch something you missed the first time, etc._

- *Where else can you use the strategies we practiced today?*

=== Investigate

[.lesson-instruction]
Ask students to create their own appropriately challenging word problem (with a solution) and collect the responses for later use as "Do Now" tasks or formative assessment.
