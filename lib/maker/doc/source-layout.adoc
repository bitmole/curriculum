== The document source layout

Our documentation sources are divided into _pathways_ and _lessons_,
which are in the subdirectories `pathways` and `lessons`
respectively. A pathway is broadly a concatenation of a chosen
ordered set of lessons (with some other pathway-specific resources
thrown in).

In the following, we'll use `core` as an example
pathway, and `simple-data-types` as an example lesson

=== Multiple natural languages

First, we may want to create the course `core` in
multiple natural languages, e.g, English (`en-us`) or Spanish
(`es-mx`). To accommodate this, the source dir `pathway/core` has
a `langs` subdir, with further subdirs for each natlang that we want:
i.e., `en-us` and `es-mx`.  The source tree thus looks like:

  pathway/
  `—— core/
      `—— langs/
          |—— en-us/
          `—— es-mx/

We'll call the `pathway/core/langs/en-us` the `core` pathway's
root directory (for the `en-us` natlang).

=== Multiple proglangs

By default, the programming language associated with a pathway is
Pyret.

We may also want to create the courses for our `core` pathway for
multiple programming languages, e.g., `pyret` and `wescheme`. To
accommodate this, we include the file `proglang.txt` in the
pathway root directory (`pathways/core/langs/en-us/`), and list
in it the various proglangs supported. Thus the contents of
`proglang.txt` will look like:

  pyret
  wescheme

Sometimes we have a pathway that has associated with it only a
single proglang, but that proglang is not Pyret. As an example,
consider the pathway `shipwrecks` which is defined for the
proglang `spreadsheets`. In this case, we still need a
`proglang.txt` file containing the single line

  spreadsheets

=== Pathway narratives

The pathway root directory has a file `index.adoc`, which
specifies the _pathway narrative_.  The pathway root also
has a `resources/` subdirectory that houses additional
documentation that is specific to teachers. The pathway root may
also contain subdirs for `front-matter`, `back-matter`, and
`images`: the former two add flanking matter to the final
workbook for the pathway's course, while `images` is a convenient
location for image subfiles.

=== Lessons associated with a pathway

The pathway root directory has a file `lesson-order.txt` listing
the names of the lessons associated with it, in order. These
lessons occur as directories in the `lessons/` directory in the
repo top dir.

As with pathways, lessons can be in different natlangs and
proglangs. To accommodate multiple natlangs, each lesson has a
`langs` subdir, with subdirs (e.g., `en-us`, `es-mx`) for the
different natlangs. (This is similar to how we specify multiple
natlangs for pathways.)

   lessons/
   `—— simple-data-types/
       `—— langs/
           |—— en-us/
           `—— es-mx/

We'll call `lessons/simple-data-types/langs/en-us` the lesson root
directory.

As for pathways, a lesson root directory can contain a
`proglang.txt` listing the proglang(s) associatable with it. If
no `proglang.txt` is present, the (single) proglang is assumed to
be `pyret`.

If more than one proglang is needed, or if the single proglang is
something other than `pyret`, list it in `proglang.txt`.

==== Lesson plans

The lesson counterpart to the pathway narrative is the _lesson
plan_, given as an `index.adoc` file in the lesson root
directory.
Here too, an `images/` subdir is used
for image subfiles.

==== Lesson workbook pages

A lesson typically contains a `pages/` subdir, which consist of
AsciiDoc sources for the pages in that lesson. The `pages/`
subdir has a file `workbook-pages.txt`, listing all these pages
in order.

A lesson may also contain other subdirs, even within its
`pages/`. These may contain files meant for inclusion in the main
pages files.

==== Adding proglang-specific source

We've seen that both pathways and lessons may have `proglang.txt`
identifying multiple proglangs as vehicles for that
course/lesson. Proglang-specific material is specified in the
source in two ways:

1: We use the directive `@ifproglang{pyret}{...}` to specify source fragments
meant for the proglang `pyret`.

2: Especially in the `pages/` subdirs, we use further subdirs
named for the proglang to add files that would shadow the main
files. Thus for a file `pages/abc.adoc`, the file
`pages/pyret/abc.adoc` would shadow it for `pyret`, and file
`pages/wescheme/abc.adoc` would shadow it for `wescheme`. If we
provide shadowing files for all relevant proglangs, the main file
doesn't need to exist.

==== Solution-mode pages

The `pages/` subdir in a lesson contributes to the student
version of the final workbook. However, we also have solutions
workbook that is intended for teachers. We have a
`solution-pages/` subdir alongside `pages/`, which contains files
that will shadow the similarly named student pages.

=== Pathway-independent files

There are also some source files that are not affiliated with any
particular pathway or lesson. These are kept in
`shared/langs/en-us/docroot` (and the like, for other natlangs). Chief among these are textbook
descriptions which are .adoc files in the `textbooks/` subdir.
