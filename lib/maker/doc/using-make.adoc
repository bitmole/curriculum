== Using the Makefile

The `Makefile` in the top directory allows to you build the
documentation system. Simply type `make`: This creates or updates the
`distribution` subdirectory with the various files
needed for the user.

=== PDF and workbook generation

By default, `make` won't create the PDF versions of the HTML files, nor the
collections of them that form the various workbooks. PDF and
workbook construction can be time-consuming process that can be
relegated to the final run, when the author is sure that the HTML
conversions have been thoroughly debugged. Once they are, and the
PDFs are desired, set the variable `BOOK` at the `make` command
line to a nonempty string, e.g.,

    make BOOK=yes

=== Link checking

By default, the checking of the various internal and external
links in the documents are not checked -- because it can be a
time-consuming process when its results are actively being
sought. To enable link checking, set the `LINKCHECK` variable to
a nonempty string, e.g.,

    make LINKCHECK=yes
