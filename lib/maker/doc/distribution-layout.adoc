== The distribution layout

The _built_ version of a pathway -- called a _course_ -- is
created in a subdirectory called `courses` under the
`distribution` subdir. The built version of a lesson -- we'll
just call it the distribution lesson -- is similarly created in a
subdir called `lessons`, also under the `distribution` suddir.

=== The distribution subdir

The `courses` and `lessons` are not direct subdirs of
`distribution`, in order to accommodate different versions of
pathways and lessons based on the natlang used. To effect this,
the `distribution` has subdirs for each natlang (called `en-us`,
`es-mx`, etc.), and it is the `courses` and `lessons` subdirs of
these that contain the natlang-specific courses and lessons.
Thus, the two natlang versions of the pathway `core` are laid out
as follows:

  distribution/
  |—— en-us/
  |   `—— courses/
  |       `—— core/
  `—— es-mx/
      `—— courses/
          `—— core/

Note that we use the same name `core` for the two natlang
versions in the distribution. We can do this because they reside
inside two different subtrees `distribution/en-us`
`distribution/es-mx` and thus don't risk a name clash.

As with pathways, so with lessons: To accommodate multiple
natlangs, the lessons go into the `lessons` subdir of their
natlang. E.g., for the lesson `simple-data-types`, we have:

  distribution/
  |—— en-us/
  |   `—— lessons/
  |       `—— simple-data-types/
  `—— es-mx/
      `—— lessons/
          `—— simple-data-types/

In the following, we will assume the prevailiing natural language is
`en-us`. For other natlangs, the setup is exactly the same but in
the appropriate natlang-based subtree.

Also, we will call `distribution/en-us/courses/core` the
course root directory (of the English version of the `core`
pathway). The dir
`distribution/en-us/lessons/simple-date-types` is the
distribution lesson root directory (of the English version of the
`simple-data-types` lesson).

=== Proglang associated with a course

Typically -- as seen in the above example -- the built name of the
pathway and the lesson are the same as their names in the source,
but not always.

By default, the programming language associated with a course is
`pyret`. This is marked in the course root directory as the 0-length
file `.cached/.proglang-pyret`.  (I.e.,
`distribution/en-us/courses/core/.cached/.proglang-pyret`.)

But
we as have seen, a pathway may have a `proglang.txt` listing a
different or multiple proglangs.

This causes two different courses for `core` to be created in
`distribution/en-us/courses`. We continue to use the unadorned
pathway name, `core`, for the Pyret version. For other proglangs,
the course dir's name uses the proglang as a hyphenated suffix.
Thus for the WeScheme version, the course is entitled
`core-wescheme`. I.e., the two course root directories are

  distribution/en-us/courses/core
  distribution/en-us/courses/core-wescheme

These two directories have their own proglang marker files, i.e.,
`.cached/.proglang-pyret` (as before)
and
`.cached/.proglang-wescheme`.

We have pathways whose `proglang.txt` contains only a single
proglang, but that proglang isn't Pyret, e.g., the pathway
`shipwrecks` whose `proglang.txt` contains only `spreadsheets`.
In such a case,
the built course is simply called `shipwrecks` rather
than `shipwrecks-spreadsheets`, since there is no Pyret version
to distinguish it from.

=== Proglang associated with a distribution lesson

As with pathways, lessons can be in different proglangs, also
specified with `proglang.txt`. If no `proglang.txt` if present,
the (single) proglang is assumed to be `pyret`.  The distribution
version of the non-Pyret lesson have the proglang as hyphenated
suffix, e.g.,

  simple-data-types-wescheme

Again, as with pathways, a proglang-marker file
`.cached/.proglang-wesceme` is placed in the distribution lesson
root to identify it as a lesson using `wescheme`.

Note that the pathway mentions in its `lesson-order.txt` the
lesson names in unadorned form. On building, a pathway becomes a
course, and the distribution lessons associated with it are the
right versions corrected for proglang. Thus the pathway `core`
has `simple-data-types` as a constituent lesson. Moving over to
the built `distribution`, the course `core` (Pyret) includes the lesson
`simple-data-types` (Pyret), and the course `core-wescheme`
includes the lesson `simple-data-types-wescheme`.
