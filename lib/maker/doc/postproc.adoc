==  Postprocessing

When the Racket preprocessing and the Asciidoctor runs complete,
we have a bunch of `+.cached/*.html+` files in our `distribution`
tree. It would be nice if these were all there is to it, but
there is still a bunch of post-processing left. We use the other
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_*` files to guide this post-processing.
