==  Postprocessing

When the Racket preprocessing and the Asciidoctor runs complete,
we have a bunch of `+.cached/*.html+` files in our `distribution`
tree. It would be nice if these were all there is to it, but
there is still a bunch of post-processing left. We use the other
`$ADOC_POSTPROC_*` files to guide this post-processing.

For starters, the `+.cached/*.html+` files need to go up one
directory, so they sit alongside their source `.adoc` files in
the `distribution` tree. (We may later choose to delete the `.adoc`
files before deployment to the website, but that's a different
matter.) In particular, we need to ensure that the final HTML
file has extension `.shtml` when it's a lesson plan or pathway
doc, either narrative or resources. It is `.html` in all other
cases, i.e., workbook pages and pathway-independent files.

The following are the components of the postprocessing:

===  CSS path correction

When Asciidoctor is run on the `.asc` file, it assumes a
`curriculum.css` file alongside the cached `.html` file. We
already have our specific `curriculum.css` file in
`distribution/en-us/lib`.
