            <h1>Our Approach to Equity</h1>
            <p>
            Equity is at the heart of our operations at Bootstrap, impacting everything from our software engineering, curriculum design, pedagogy, and scaling model. As one of the largest providers of in-school computer and data science, we're proud that nearly 50% of our students self-identify as students of color, and nearly 45% are girls and young women.
            </p>

            <h2>Scaling for Equity</h2>
            <p>
                We'll need 100,000 CS teachers to put a CS class in every school. Recruiting and training these teachers is expensive, and with <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/documents/respect/teaching-profession-facts.doc">50% of new teachers leaving in their first five years</a>, we'll need <i>double</i> that number. This makes the "CSforAll" mission accessible to only the wealthiest states and districts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even for those districts, putting a CS class in every school doesn't address equity unless the students in the class represent the students in the school! There are limited hours in the day and limited rooms in the building, so <i>where does a CS class fit?</i> If the CS class is an opt-in elective, the students who don't see themselves as "CS people" are <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/246538-towards-equity-in-k-12-computer-science-education-consistency-cumulativity-and-competencies/">less likely to sign up</a>. Every new graduation requirement means more students who may not graduate, so a required class will face enormous pressure on those classes to sacrifice rigor. Whether elective or required, CS classes must work hard to avoid widening existing gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                By focusing on <i>integration</i>, Bootstrap allows schools to scale computer science without finding room in the budget for a new teacher, or room in the schedule for a new class. And by linking our CS learning outcomes to the learning goals of the math, science, or history classroom, we can be <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sfk-bsa-scaff-unscaff-wp/">rigorous and explicit</a> about our learning outcomes. Finally, by leveraging the teachers who already reach every child, <strong>we can reach CSforAll at a fraction of the time and cost.</strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Engineering for Equity</h2>
            <p>
                Many computer and data science classes use tools that must be downloaded and installed on student computers, or web-based versions that come with cloud computing costs in the hundreds or thousands of dollars <i>per year</i>. For affluent schools with their own IT staff or a generous budget, these are at worst small nuisances. But for most schools, downloaded software or subscription fees represent a serious barrier to equity! <strong>That's why all of Bootstrap tools are 100% free, and requires no download or installation.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                But equity is about more than what the software costs - it's also about how it works! For students who don't yet identify as programmers, an inscrutable error message can be the sign that they "don't belong". A confusing error makes students helpless, dependent on the teacher. At Bootstrap, we've invested extraordinary resources in building <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/blog/software/Errors.shtml">tools with helpful errors</a>, and <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-measur-effect-error-msg-novice-sigcse/">published research</a> to help other programs do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equity also means considering the needs of differently-abled students. Most programming tools rely heavily on visual cues, leaving out students who are colorblind or otherwise visually impaired. We've invested considerable resources in <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/blog/accessibility/User-Interface-REPL.shtml">making our tools screenreader-accessible</a>, and have begun providing alternate styling for students with different types of color-blindness. As with our error messages, we've also worked to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sbk-accessible-ast-blocks/">publish the results from these efforts</a> so that others can learn from our experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Writing Curriculum for Equity</h2>
            Putting a curriculum in front of all students doesn't make it equitable. We use a number of mechanisms to keep our materials focused on issues of equity:
            <ul>
                <li>All of our lessons are developed with an eye towards the <a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/sites/default/files/2017-06/TT_Social_Justice_Standards_0.pdf">Social Justice Standards</a>, an anti-bias framework from Learning for Justice.</li> 
                <li>We include diverse representations of mathematicians and computing pioneers in our materials.</li>
                <li>We choose real-world examples and use names that represent the diversity of our students.</li>
                <li>We recently completed an internal audit of our curriculum, using the "Assessing Bias in Standards and Curricular Materials" framework. This audit found a number of weaknesses in our materials, which we've been working to address as part of our ongoing release cycle.</li>
                <li>Not every student has a computer - or even internet access! - at home. That's why our materials include a pencil-and-paper workbook, which allows students to practice their skills even if they're not in front of the keyboard. And of course, these books are available as free PDFs as well.</li>
