            <h1>Our Approach to Equity</h1>
            <p>
            Equity is at the heart of our operations at Bootstrap, impacting everything from our curriculum design, pedagogy, software engineering, and scaling model. As one of the largest providers of in-school computer and data science, we're proud that nearly 50% of our students self-identify as students of color, and nearly 45% are girls and young women.
            </p>

            <h2>Curriculum Design</h2>
            Putting a curriculum in front of all students doesn't make it equitable. We use a number of mechanisms to keep our materials focused on issues of equity:
            <ul>
                <li>All of our lessons are developed with an eye towards the <a href="https://www.learningforjustice.org/sites/default/files/2017-06/TT_Social_Justice_Standards_0.pdf">Social Justice Standards</a>, an anti-bias framework from Learning for Justice.</li> 
                <li>We include diverse representations of mathematicians and computing pioneers in our materials.</li>
                <li>We choose real-world examples and use names that represent the diversity of our students.</li>
                <li>We recently completed an internal audit of our curriculum, using the "Assessing Bias in Standards and Curricular Materials" framework. This audit found a number of weaknesses in our materials, which we've been working to address as part of our ongoing release cycle.</li>
                <li>Not every student has a computer - or even internet access! - at home. That's why our materials include a pencil-and-paper workbook, which allows students to practice their skills even if they're not in front of the keyboard. And of course, these books are available as free PDFs as well.</li>
                <li>Our curricular materials are designed to be relevant and inclusive for a wide range of students. Our Data Science curriculum offers <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/materials/latest/en-us/lessons/choosing-your-dataset/index.shtml#Datasets">ready-to-use datasets</a> on everything from politics to entertainment, or from sports to science. Our curricula is filled with projects that are tailored to student interests, such as creating a personalized videogame, drawing a flag, or publishing original research on a relevant topic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pedagogy</h2>
            <p>
                While popular in many CS-Ed classrooms, the "here's a challenge, <i>just figure it out!</i>" approach is blind to the fact that not all students feel equally confident in their abilities, or whether they belong in a computer science class at all. For students impacted by anxiety, fear, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat">stereotype threat</a>, productive struggle can quickly turn into panic unless there's a structure in place to support their struggle.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The pedagogical techniques we use (e.g. - Circles of Evaluation, Contracts, Design Recipe, Notice &amp; Wonder, etc) are designed with structure in mind, so that every student has a set of strategies they can try before "giving up" and asking the teacher to get them un-stuck. We train teachers to use this structure, so that many questions can be answered simply by referring back to the structure - and never giving away the answer. By redirecting students back to their own work and their own thinking, Bootstrap teachers build self-confidence in their students.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inclusive and culturally-relevant pedagogy is critical to creating a healthy classroom environment, and there's no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all approach. We employ a variety of pedagogical strategies to support students from diverse backgrounds and with different abilities.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Teamwork and collaboration are used throughout the curriculum, with explicit scaffolds and structures in place for students to work together and support each other. Programming is done in pairs, with many unplugged activities designed for groups of 2-5. Students switch between roles, giving them multiple opportunities to excel and grow.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We use real-world issues that affect the students in our classrooms, with support for teachers to tailor their examples and projects to things that are relevant to their students.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Class discussions provide opportunities for students to share diverse points of view, interpretations, and lived experiences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many of our techniques are intentionally designed to interrupt practices that negatively impact vulnerable and marginalized students. For example, Bootstrap teachers  never call on the first student to raise their hand! Instead, they wait a few seconds to see who else raises their hand (giving more time for students to think, de-emphasizing speed as the important factor) and then call on multiple students to share their answers (more opportunity for discussion, emphasizing collaboration).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>


            <h2>Engineering</h2>
            <p>
                Many computer and data science classes use tools that must be downloaded and installed on student computers, or web-based versions that come with cloud computing costs in the hundreds or thousands of dollars <i>per year</i>. For affluent schools with their own IT staff or a generous budget, these are at worst small nuisances. But for most schools, downloaded software or subscription fees represent a serious barrier to equity! <strong>That's why all of Bootstrap tools are 100% free, and requires no download or installation.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                But equity is about more than what the software costs - it's also about how it works! For students who don't yet identify as programmers, an inscrutable error message can be the sign that they "don't belong". A confusing error makes students helpless, dependent on the teacher. At Bootstrap, we've invested extraordinary resources in building <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/blog/software/Errors.shtml">tools with helpful errors</a>, and <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/mfk-measur-effect-error-msg-novice-sigcse/">published research</a> to help other programs do the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equity also means considering the needs of differently-abled students. Most programming tools rely heavily on visual cues, leaving out students who are colorblind or otherwise visually impaired. We've invested considerable resources in <a href="https://bootstrapworld.org/blog/accessibility/User-Interface-REPL.shtml">making our tools screenreader-accessible</a>, and have begun providing alternate styling for students with different types of color-blindness. As with our error messages, we've also worked to <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sbk-accessible-ast-blocks/">publish the results from these efforts</a> so that others can learn from our experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Scaling Model</h2>
            <p>
                We'll need 100,000 CS teachers to put a CS class in every school. Recruiting and training these teachers is expensive, and with <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/documents/respect/teaching-profession-facts.doc">50% of new teachers leaving in their first five years</a>, we'll need <i>double</i> that number. This makes the "CSforAll" mission accessible to only the wealthiest states and districts. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even for those districts, putting a CS class in every school doesn't address equity unless the students in the class represent the students in the school! There are limited hours in the day and limited rooms in the building, so <i>where does a CS class fit?</i> If the CS class is an opt-in elective, the students who don't see themselves as "CS people" are <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/246538-towards-equity-in-k-12-computer-science-education-consistency-cumulativity-and-competencies/">less likely to sign up</a>. Every new graduation requirement means more students who may not graduate, so a required class will face enormous pressure on those classes to sacrifice rigor. Whether elective or required, CS classes must work hard to avoid widening existing gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
                By focusing on <i>integration</i>, Bootstrap allows schools to scale computer science without finding room in the budget for a new teacher, or room in the schedule for a new class. And by linking our CS learning outcomes to the learning goals of the math, science, or history classroom, we can be <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sfk-bsa-scaff-unscaff-wp/">rigorous and explicit</a> about our learning outcomes. Finally, by leveraging the teachers who already reach every child, <strong>we can reach CSforAll at a fraction of the time and cost.</strong>
